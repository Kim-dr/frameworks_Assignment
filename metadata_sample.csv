y7ja97fi,,WHO,Calcium ion binding to calmodulin: binding free energy calculation using the molecular mechanics Poisson-Boltzmann surface area (MM-PBSA) method by incorporating implicit polarization,,,,unk,"Binding of calcium ion to calcium-binding proteins (CBP) triggers a large number of biological processes in a cell. CBP are known to play important roles in various diseases, such as cancer, alzheimer, and neuronal problems. However, the calculation of the binding affinity of calcium ion to CBP still possesses a significant challenge to the computational investigators. One of the main reasons for this difficulty is the polarization of CBP due to the binding of calcium. In the current work, we have used the implicit polarization method of Leontyev et al. (PCCP, 13.7 (2011): 2613-2626) to calculate the binding free energy of calcium ion binding to calmodulin, an important CBP. We have used the widely used MM-PBSA method to find a good protocol of calculation with implicit polarization. We have also optimized the best value of the calcium radius to match the experimental results. Our results show incorporation of polarization improves the agreement between the calculated and experimental results, although still, some discrepancy remains. On the whole, this work shows implicit polarization when combined with the MM-PBSA method can give results better than calculation without any polarization, and further improvement is necessary to get a quantitative match with experiments.

0jiaevmw,,WHO,University Students' Persistence with Technology-Mediated Distance Education: A Response to COVID-19 and Beyond in Zimbabwe,,,,unk,"Technology-mediated distance education (TDE) has become part of the new normal in the range of teaching strategies used in universities in Zimbabwe. Contemporary literature abounds with studies that highlight challenges associated with access to education in universities, yet very little is highlighted about how TDE can be used to enhance access to education in Zimbabwean universities during the COVID-19 era and beyond. The purpose of this study was therefore to investigate determinants of students' behavioural intentions to persist with TDE in universities in Zimbabwe during COVID-19 and beyond. The study employed a quantitative approach that used a self-constructed structured questionnaire for data collection from a sample of 1,300 distance learning students selected from five universities using a stratified random sampling strategy. Structural equation modelling using IBM SPSS Amos 22 was used for data analysis. Results of the study show that cultural and norms issues (beta=.325;p<.001) and characteristics of the students (beta=.329;p<.001), the lecturer (beta=.362;p<.001), the institution (beta=.427;p<.001), and external stakeholders (beta=.279;p<.001) were all significantly associated with the behavioural intentions of university students to persist with TDE.

Women and men of ages 20 to 80 volunteered to donate for this program. Most of the blood came from healthy individuals, and many remained healthy throughout the years of their blood donations. The major objective was to determine the extent that blood leukocyte numbers change so that transient vs more lingering changes may be helpful in assessing health status. Since some donors remained in the program for 14 years, age influences over time could be determined. Within a short period of 2–3 years, the flow cytometric immunophenotypic profile of blood lymphocyte is relatively stable with a CV% of < 20%. However, as humans age, the blood CD3(+) T cell, CD8(+) T cell, B cell, NKT cell, and CD4(−)/CD8(−) double-negative T cell (DN-T cell) subsets declined in cell numbers/μL, but the double-positive CD4(+)/CD8(+) T cells (DP-T cells) increased in numbers. The extent and chronology of a variance, e.g., a subset exceeding its 75th or 90th percentile, might be indicative of a transient or chronic physiological or psychosocial stress affecting health or a developing pathology; however, because of the wide ranges of cell numbers/μL for each subset among individuals reported as healthy, everyone’s immunity and health must be carefully evaluated. A CD4 to CD8 ratio (4/8R) of < 1 has been used to define an immunodeficiency such as HIV-induced AIDS, but a high 4/8R is less well associated with health status. A high 4/8R or granulocyte to lymphocyte ratio (GLR) might be an indicator of a stress, infection, or immune-related pathology. Sporadic and longitudinal increases of GLRs are reported. The results suggest that there are some age and sex differences in leukocyte numbers; stress influences on the blood profile of leukocytes likely exist. However, some values exceeding 2 standard deviations from means do not necessarily predict a health concern, whereas a longitudinal increase or decline might be indicative of a need for further evaluations.",2022-01-13,"Kasten-Jolly, Jane; Lawrence, David A.",Immunol Res,,,,document_parses/pdf_json/5a5c24c3bcd662f89c24559e2c890ba82298821e.json,document_parses/pmc_json/PMC8754550.xml.json,https://doi.org/10.1007/s12026-021-09257-6; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/35023048/,245932666.0

scb07lhk,,WHO,Willingness to participate in COVID-19 vaccine trials; a survey among a population of healthcare workers in Uganda,,,,unk,"BACKGROUND: Healthcare workers (HCWs) are at high risk of acquiring SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19 and may therefore be a suitable population for COVID-19 vaccine trials. We conducted a survey to evaluate willingness-to-participate in COVID-19 vaccine trials in a population of HCWs at three hospitals in Uganda. METHODS: The survey was conducted between September and November 2020. Using a standardised questionnaire, data were collected on socio-demographics, previous participation in health research, COVID-19 information sources, underlying health conditions, and willingness-to-participate in COVID-19 vaccine trials. Data were analysed descriptively and a binomial generalised linear model with a log link function used to investigate factors associated with unwillingness to participate. RESULTS: 657 HCWs (female, 63%) were enrolled with a mean age of 33 years (Standard Deviation, 10). Overall willingness-to-participate was 70.2%. Key motivating factors for participation were: hope of being protected against COVID-19 (81.1%), altruism (73.3%), and the opportunity to get health care (26.0%). Selected hypothetical trial attributes reduced willingness-to-participate as follows: weekly-quarterly study visits over a 12-month period (70.2%-63.2%, P = 0.026); provision of approximately 50ml of blood at each study visit (70.2%-63.2%, P = 0.026); risk of mild-moderate local adverse reactions (70.2%-60.3%, P<0.001); chance of receiving candidate vaccine or placebo (70.2%-56.9%, P<0.001); and delay of pregnancy [Overall, 70.2%-57.1% P<0.001); Female, 62.8%-48.4% (P = 0.002); Male, 82.5%-71.5% (P = 0.003)]. Collectively, these attributes reduced willingness-to-participate from [70.2%-42.2% (P<0.001) overall; 82.5%-58.1% (P<0.001) in men; 62.8%-32.6% (P<0.001) in women]. Among individuals that were unwilling to participate, the commonest barriers were concerns over vaccine safety (54.6%) and fear of catching SARS-CoV-2 (31.6%). Unwillingness to participate was associated with being female (aRR 1.97, CI 1.46-2.67, P<0.001) and having university or other higher-level education (aRR 1.52, CI 1.05-2.2, P = 0.026).

Although individual attitudes may be modified through training, macro- and meso-issues require system-level interventions. This paper analyzes the role of individual-, institutional-, and city-level factors in shaping attitudes toward refugee claimants’ access to health care among Canadian health care personnel. A total of 4207 health care personnel in 16 institutions located in Montreal and Toronto completed an online survey on attitudes regarding health care access for refugee claimants. We used multilevel logistic regression analysis to identify individual-, institutional-, and city-level predictors of endorsing access to care. Participants who had prior contact with refugee claimants had greater odds of endorsing access to care than those who did not (OR 1.13; 95% CI 1.05, 1.21). Attitudes varied with occupation: social workers had the highest probability of endorsing equal access to health care (.83; 95% CI .77, .89) followed by physicians (.77; 95% CI .71, .82). An estimated 7.97% of the individual variation in endorsement of equal access to health care was attributable to differences between institutions, but this association was no longer statistically significant after adjusting for city residence. Results indicate that the contexts in which health care professionals live and work are important when understanding opinions on access to health care for vulnerable populations. They suggest that institutional interventions promoting a collective mission to care for vulnerable populations may improve access to health care for precarious status migrants.",2021-09-10,"Rousseau, Cécile; Rummens, Joanna Anneke; Frounfelker, Rochelle L.; Yebenes, Monica Ruiz Casares; Cleveland, Janet",J Int Migr Integr,,,,document_parses/pdf_json/d40ecfd9500ffeb11a00fd6286f5a5038311ab1d.json,document_parses/pmc_json/PMC8429477.xml.json,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8429477/,

Black and Hispanic people suffer disproportionately high rates of infection with SARS-CoV-2, hospitalization, and mortality, compared to non-Hispanic White people. However, case fatality rates have been shown to be similar across racial and ethnic groups. Less is known about the factors underpinning the similar case fatality rates between different racial and ethnic populations. METHODS: This retrospective cohort study analyzed outcomes for patients with COVID-19 hospitalized at MedStar Health institutions between March 1st, 2020 and July 1st, 2020. MedStar Health is a large health system with 9 hospitals in the Baltimore-Washington DC region. Data was abstracted from electronic health records, with patients stratified based on their race and ethnicity. The primary outcome was survival to hospital discharge, and secondary outcomes included need for mechanical ventilation. Statistical analyses included descriptive statistics and multi-variate logistic regressions. RESULTS: 3,165 patients were included in this analysis. The mean age of the cohort was 60.2 years (SD 17.3) and 49% were female. 14.7% were non-Hispanic White patients, 57.2% were non-Hispanic Black patients, and 20.7% were Hispanic. Hispanic patients were significantly younger than the cohort, with a mean age of 50.0 years. The overall survival of this cohort was 84.3%, with 79.8% survival for non-Hispanic White patients, 83.3% for non-Hispanic Black patients, and 89.8% for Hispanic patients. Hispanic patients had lower odds of death than non-Hispanic White patients (OR=0.45, CI 0.32-0.63), but this difference was no longer present when controlling for patient age. Non-Hispanic Black patients (OR=1.35, CI 1.04-1.75) and Hispanic patients (OR=1.43, CI 1.06-1.93) had significantly increased odds of needing mechanical ventilation, with persistence of this difference when controlling for age, gender, insurance, and comorbidities. CONCLUSIONS: In this large cohort of patients from the Baltimore-Washington DC region hospitalized for SARS-CoV-2 infection, we demonstrate that patients of Hispanic ethnicity have higher odds of severe illness, as defined by need for mechanical ventilation, but lower hospital mortality than non-Hispanic White patients. The lower hospital mortality rate is likely mediated by the younger age of this group. CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: Policy makers should consider interventions to target the social determinants such as differences in access to health care and risk of exposure to COVID-19 that may account for the higher odds of severe infection and delayed presentation among Hispanic patients. Additionally, our findings suggest that Hispanic community may be shouldering a disproportionate burden of chronic illness related to surviving severe COVID-19.

5hqpxgpn,,WHO,Care pathway and prioritization of rapid testing for COVID-19 in UK hospitals: a qualitative evaluation,,,,unk,"OBJECTIVES: The second wave of the coronavirus pandemic is now established, occurring at a time of winter pressure on acute care in the NHS. This is likely to be more challenging then the first wave for the diagnosis of COVID-19 because of the similar symptomology with other respiratory conditions highly prevalent in winter. This study sought to understand the care pathways in place in UK NHS hospitals during the first wave (March-July 2020) for identification of patients with COVID-19 and to learn lessons to inform optimal testing strategies within the COVID-19 National Diagnostic Research and Evaluation Platform (CONDOR). DESIGN, SETTING & PARTICIPANTS: Sixteen hospital-based clinicians from 12 UK NHS Trusts covering 10 different specialties were interviewed following a semi-structured topic guide. Data were coded soon after the interviews and analysed thematically. RESULTS: We developed a diagrammatic, high-level visualisation of the care pathway describing the main clinical decisions associated with the diagnosis and management of patients with suspected COVID-19. COVID-19 testing influenced infection control considerations more so than treatment decisions. Two main features of service provision influenced the patient management significantly: access to rapid laboratory testing and the number of single occupancy rooms. If time to return of result was greater than 24 h, patients with a presumptive diagnosis would often be cohorted based on clinical suspicion alone. Undetected COVID-19 during this time could therefore lead to an increased risk of viral transmission. CONCLUSIONS: During the winter months, priority for provision of rapid testing at admission should be given to hospitals with limited access to laboratory services and single room availability. Access to rapid testing is essential for urgent decisions related to emergency surgery, maternity services and organ transplant. The pathway and prioritization of need will inform the economic modelling, clinical evaluations, and implementation of new clinical tests in UK.",2021,"Hicks, Timothy; Winter, Amanda; Green, Kile; Kierkegaard, Patrick; Price, D Ashley; Body, Richard; Allen, A Joy; Graziadio, Sara",BMC Health Serv Res,,#1249555,,,,,234406155.0
h0pjy572,,WHO,92 Clinical Frailty Scoring Is Crucial For the COVID-19 Era and Beyond,,,,unk,"Introduction The COVID-19 pandemic placed a new focus on provision of clinical resources. With high mortality and limited capacity;appropriate decisions to escalate to critical care were vital for just resource allocation but also to prevent harm where interventions would not change outcomes. NICE guidance highlighted Clinical frailty scoring (CFS) as central to the decision-making process. 1, Despite initial criticism, recent evidence has confirmed increasing CFS as an independent risk factor to inpatient mortality in COVID-19.2 We conducted a quality improvement project with the aim of improving CFS documentation at the Royal Free Hospital. Methods We reviewed the notes of 71 inpatients over the age of 65 years from 6 wards on 08/05/20–12/05/20 for both a CFS score documentation and clear treatment escalation plan at time points of initial clerking, post-take and following ward admission with an audit standard of 100%. We developed teaching sessions, promoted the CFS mobile application, developed a post-take sticker and an elderly medicine ward admission proforma. We re-audited 66 inpatient notes from the same 6 wards from 25/06/20–07/07/20. Results Documentation.of CFS improved from 7% to 17% for clerking and post-take and from 13% to 24% on the ward admission. The number of patients with treatment escalation plans was 50%. Conclusion CFS is crucial for the COVID-19 era and beyond. We have demonstrated that increased awareness improves use of CFS, though it is not yet being widely used in escalation decisions. 1.

Oxidoreductases and oxidative stress are also involved in viral infections. In this overview, different aspects of the role of cellular oxidoreductases and oxidative stress during viral infections are discussed from a chemotherapeutic viewpoint. AREAS COVERED Entry of enveloped viruses into their target cells is triggered by the interaction of viral envelope glycoproteins with cellular (co)receptor(s) and depends on obligatory conformational changes in these viral envelope glycoproteins and/or cellular receptors. For some viruses, these conformational changes are mediated by cell surface-associated cellular oxidoreductases, which mediate disulfide bridge reductions in viral envelope glycoprotein(s). Therefore, targeting these oxidoreductases using oxidoreductase inhibitors might yield an interesting strategy to block viral entry of these viruses. Furthermore, since viral infections are often associated with systemic oxidative stress, contributing to disease progression, the enhancement of the cellular antioxidant defense systems might have potential as an adjuvant antiviral strategy, slowing down disease progression. EXPERT OPINION Promising antiviral data were obtained for both strategies. However, potential pitfalls have also been identified for these strategies, indicating that it is important to carefully assess the benefits versus risks of these antiviral strategies.",2016,"Mathys, Leen; Balzarini, Jan",Expert opinion on therapeutic targets,,,,,,https://doi.org/10.1517/14728222.2015.1068760; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26178644/,207486770.0

Genomic studies can be helpful in understanding the disease dynamics. We have downloaded 324 complete and near complete SARS-CoV-2 genomes submitted in GISAID database from Bangladesh which were isolated between 30 March to 7 September, 2020. We then compared these genomes with Wuhan reference sequence and found 4160 mutation events including 2253 missense single nucleotide variations, 38 deletions and 10 insertions. The C>T nucleotide change was most prevalent (41% of all muations) possibly due to selective mutation pressure to reduce CpG sites to evade CpG targeted host immune response. The most frequent mutation that occurred in 98% isolates was 3037C>T which is a synonymous change that almost always accompanied 3 other mutations that include 241C>T, 14408C>T (P323L in RdRp) and 23403A>G (D614G in spike protein). The P323L was reported to increase mutation rate and D614G is associated with increased viral replication and currently most prevalent variant circulating all over the world. We identified multiple missense mutations in B-cell and T-cell predicted epitope regions and/or PCR target regions (including R203K and G204R that occurred in 86% of the isolates) that may impact immunogenicity and/or RT-PCR based diagnosis. Our analysis revealed 5 large deletion events in ORF7a and ORF8 gene products that may be associated with less severity of the disease and increased viral clearance. Our phylogeny analysis identified most of the isolates belonged to the Nextstrain clade 20B (86%) and GISAID clade GR (88%). Most of our isolates shared common ancestors either directly with European countries or jointly with middle eastern countries as well as Australia and India. Interestingly, the 19B clade (GISAID S clade) was unique to Chittagong which was originally prevalent in China. This reveals possible multiple introduction of the virus in Bangladesh via different routes. Hence more genome sequencing and analysis with related clinical data is needed to interpret functional significance and better predict the disease dynamics that may be helpful for policy makers to control the COVID-19 pandemic in Bangladesh.",2020-10-16,"Rahman, Md.

In addition, candidacy research has only rarely studied the views of carers and health professionals. In this article, we use concepts relating to candidacy to enable a theoretically informed examination of experiences of access to secondary mental health services during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic in England. We report a qualitative study of the views and experiences of service users, carers, and healthcare professionals. Analysis of 65 in-depth interviews was based on the constant comparative method. We found that wide-ranging service changes designed to address the imperatives of the pandemic were highly consequential for people's candidacy. Macro-level changes, including increased emphasis on crisis and risk management and adapted risk assessment systems, produced effects that went far beyond restrictions in the availability of services: they profoundly re-structured service users' identification of their own candidacy, including perceptions of what counted as a problem worthy of attention and whether they as individuals needed, deserved, and were entitled to care. Services became less permeable, such that finding a point of entry to those services that remained open, required more work of service users and carers. Healthcare professionals were routinely confronted by complex decisions and ethical dilemmas about provision of care, and their implicit judgements about access may have important implications for equity. Many of the challenges of access exposed by the pandemic related to pre-existing resource deficits and institutional weaknesses in care for people living with mental health difficulties. Overall, these findings affirm the value of the construct of candidacy for explaining access to mental healthcare, but also enable deepened understanding of the specific features of candidacy, offering enduring learning and implications for policy and practice.",2022-01-10,"Liberati, Elisa; Richards, Natalie; Parker, Jennie; Willars, Janet; Scott, David; Boydell, Nicola; Pinfold, Vanessa; Martin, Graham; Jones, Peter B.; Dixon-Woods, Mary",Soc Sci Med,,,,document_parses/pdf_json/7ffb0ee80424503aa73471fa9acfb27f846f0c73.json,document_parses/pmc_json/PMC8744250.xml.json,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0277953622000144?v=s5; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0277953622000144; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/35063916/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.socscimed.2022.114711,245838395.0

We developed an open biomedical knowledge graph–based system termed Reasoning Over Biomedical Objects linked in Knowledge Oriented Pathways (ROBOKOP). ROBOKOP consists of both a front-end user interface and a back-end knowledge graph. The ROBOKOP user interface allows users to posit questions and explore answer subgraphs. Users can also posit questions through direct Cypher query of the underlying knowledge graph, which currently contains roughly 6 million nodes or biomedical entities and 140 million edges or predicates describing the relationship between nodes, drawn from over 30 curated data sources. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to apply ROBOKOP to survey data on workplace exposures and immune-mediated diseases from the Environmental Polymorphisms Registry (EPR) within the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences. METHODS: We analyzed EPR survey data and identified 45 associations between workplace chemical exposures and immune-mediated diseases, as self-reported by study participants (n= 4574), with 20 associations significant at P<.05 after false discovery rate correction. We then used ROBOKOP to (1) validate the associations by determining whether plausible connections exist within the ROBOKOP knowledge graph and (2) propose biological mechanisms that might explain them and serve as hypotheses for subsequent testing. We highlight the following three exemplar associations: carbon monoxide-multiple sclerosis, ammonia-asthma, and isopropanol-allergic disease. RESULTS: ROBOKOP successfully returned answer sets for three queries that were posed in the context of the driving examples. The answer sets included potential intermediary genes, as well as supporting evidence that might explain the observed associations. CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrate real-world application of ROBOKOP to generate mechanistic hypotheses for associations between workplace chemical exposures and immune-mediated diseases. We expect that ROBOKOP will find broad application across many biomedical fields and other scientific disciplines due to its generalizability, speed to discovery and generation of mechanistic hypotheses, and open nature.",2021-07-20,"Fecho, Karamarie; Bizon, Chris; Miller, Frederick; Schurman, Shepherd; Schmitt, Charles; Xue, William; Morton, Kenneth; Wang, Patrick; Tropsha, Alexander",JMIR Med Inform,,,,document_parses/pdf_json/2259315a98980308afaa3ff6615675341b738567.json,document_parses/pmc_json/PMC8335603.xml.json,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34283031/; https://doi.org/10.2196/26714,235868885.0

Monitoring the burden of disease by serological assay could be used as an early warning system for imminent outbreaks as an increased seroprevalance often precedes larger outbreaks. However, the multitude of highly pathogenic viruses necessitates the need to identify specific antibodies against several targets from both humans as well as from potential reservoir animals such as bats. In order to address this, we have developed a broadly reactive multiplex microsphere immunoassay (MMIA) for the detection of antibodies against several highly pathogenic viruses from both humans and animals. To this aim, nucleoproteins (NP) of Ebola virus (EBOV), Marburg virus (MARV) and nucleocapsid proteins (NP) of Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever virus, Rift Valley fever virus and Dobrava-Belgrade hantavirus were employed in a 5-plex assay for IgG detection. After optimisation, specific binding to each respective NP was shown by testing sera from humans and non-human primates with known infection status. The usefulness of our assay for serosurveillance was shown by determining the immune response against the NP antigens in a panel of 129 human serum samples collected in Guinea between 2011 and 2012 in comparison to a panel of 88 sera from the German blood bank. We found good agreement between our MMIA and commercial or in-house reference methods by ELISA or IIFT with statistically significant higher binding to both EBOV NP and MARV NP coupled microspheres in the Guinea panel. Finally, the MMIA was successfully adapted to detect antibodies from bats that had been inoculated with EBOV- and MARV- virus-like particles, highlighting the versatility of this technique and potentially enabling the monitoring of wildlife as well as human populations with this assay. We were thus able to develop and validate a sensitive and broadly reactive high-throughput serological assay which could be used as a screening tool to detect antibodies against several highly pathogenic viruses.",2020-10-23,"Surtees, Rebecca; Stern, Daniel; Ahrens, Katharina; Kromarek, Nicole; Lander, Angelika; Kreher, Petra; Weiss, Sabrina; Hewson, Roger; Punch, Emma K; Barr, John N; Witkowski, Peter T; Couacy-Hymann, Emmanuel; Marzi, Andrea; Dorner, Brigitte G; Kurth, Andreas",PLoS neglected tropical diseases,,,,,,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pntd.0008699; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33095766/,225059227.0
aao90qyt,,Medline,Evaluation of In Vivo Toxicity of Biological Nanoparticles.,10.1002/cpz1.249,,34542934,unk,"Biologically derived nanoparticles such as extracellular vesicles are promising candidates for therapeutic applications. In vivo toxicity of biological nanoparticles can result in tissue or organ damage, immunological perturbations, or developmental effects but cannot be readily predicted from in vitro studies. Therefore, an essential component of the preclinical assessment of these particles for their use as therapeutics requires screening for adverse effects and detailed characterization of their toxicity in vivo. However, there are no standardized, comprehensive methods to evaluate the toxicity profile of nanoparticle treatment in a preclinical model. Here, we first describe a method to prepare bovine milk-derived nanovesicles (MNVs). These MNVs are inexpensive to isolate, have a scalable production platform, and can be modified to achieve a desired biological effect. We also describe two vertebrate animal models, mice and zebrafish, that can be employed to evaluate the toxicity profile of biologically derived nanoparticles, using MNVs as an example. Treatment-induced organ toxicity and immunological effects can be assessed in mice receiving systemic injections of MNVs, and developmental toxicity can be assessed in zebrafish embryos exposed to MNVs in embryo water. Utilizing these animal models provides opportunities to analyze the toxicity profiles of therapeutic extracellular vesicles in vivo. © 2021 Wiley Periodicals LLC.

A 73-year-old man traveling on a cruise ship with history of hypertension and dyslipidemia developed high fever, dyspnea and cough after 7 days of steroid treatment for sudden sensorineural hearing loss, and tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 in sputa polymerase chain reaction (PCR) examination. His respiratory function deteriorated despite treatments with lopinavir/ritonavir, oseltamivir, azithromycin and meropenem at a regional hospital. He was intubated and transferred to the ICU in the tertiary university hospital on day 10 (ICU day 1). Interferon beta-1b subcutaneous injection was initiated immediately to enhance anti-viral therapy, and favipiravir on ICU day 10 upon availability. Progression of organ dysfunctions necessitated inhalation of nitrogen oxide for respiratory dysfunction, noradrenaline for cardiovascular dysfunction and continuous renal replacement therapy for renal dysfunction. His blood samples PCR also tested positive for SARS-CoV-2, indicating viremia, concomitantly with elevated IL-6 levels.

In comparison FMT has more limited efficacy in treating either ulcerative colitis (UC) or Crohn's disease (CD), two forms of inflammatory bowel disesases (IBD). We hypothesize that FMT recipients with rCDI and/or IBD have baseline bile acid (BA)compositions that differ significantly from that of their healthy donorsand may be normalized by FMT. Aim To study the effect of single colonoscopic FMT on the microbial composition and function of recipients with rCDI and/or IBD. Methods Multi-omic analysis was performed on stools from 55 pairs of subjects and donors enrolled in two prospective single arm FMT clinical trials [ClinicalTrials.gov ID:NCT03268213, 479696, IND 15642, ClinicalTrials.gov ID: NCT03267238, IND 16795]. Fitted linear models were used to examine the effects of four recipient groups (rCDI withoutIBD, rCDI with IBD, UC without rCDI, CD without rCDI), FMT status (Donor, preFMT, 1 week postFMT, 3 months postFMT) and first order Group*FMT interactions. Results FMT was effective in preventing rCDI for up to one year in 92% of the rCDI without IBD group and 75% of the rCDI with IBD recipients. The donor/recipient Sorensen similarity index was < 0.6 in all donor/CDI recipient pairs but > 0.6 in some donor/IBD only recipient pairs at baseline. Increasing post-FMT similarity indices > 0.6 in IBD recipients, was not clearly associated with reduced fecal calprotectin levels. Fecal secondary BA levels were lower in rCDI without IBD, CDI with IBD and CD without rCDI recipients compared to donors. FMT restored secondary BA levels in these recipients. Metagenomic baiE gene and some of the 8 bile salt hydrolase (BSH) phylotype abundances were significantly correlated with fecal BA levels. Conclusion Restoration of multiple secondary BA levels, including those recently implicated in immunomodulation, are associated with restoration of fecal baiE gene counts, suggesting that 7dihydroxylation step is rate limiting.",2022-02-15,"Jesus Faustino Ramos, R.; Zhu, C.; Joseph, D.

METHODS: Forty-seven inpatients with confirmed COVID-19 had blood samples drawn on admission for assessing serum biomarkers of CNS injury by Single molecule array (Simoa), NfL and GFAp. Concentrations of NfL and GFAp were analyzed in relation to symptoms, clinical signs, inflammatory biomarkers and clinical outcomes. We used multivariate linear models to test for differences in biomarker concentrations in the subgroups, accounting for confounding effects. RESULTS: In total, 21% (n = 10) of the patients were admitted to an intensive care unit, and the overall mortality rate was 13% (n = 6). Non-survivors had higher serum concentrations of NfL (p < 0.001) upon admission than patients who were discharged alive both in adjusted analyses (p = 2.6 × 10-7) and unadjusted analyses (p = 0.001). The concentrations of NfL in non-survivors increased over repeated measurements; whereas, the concentrations in survivors were stable. The GFAp concentration was also significantly higher in non-survivors than survivors (p = 0.02).

However, in some facilities, diagnostic breast imaging services continued for patients with a high clinical suspicion of breast cancer. The objective of this study was to evaluate changes in the diagnostic interval (DI) of non-screening patients presenting for diagnostic mammography during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: Retrospective chart review was performed on patients presenting for non-screening diagnostic mammography from April 1 to June 30, 2020 (pandemic group) and April 1 to June 30, 2019 (pre-pandemic group). Age, reason for referral, number and type of imaging studies/biopsies necessary for a final diagnosis were recorded. Diagnostic interval (DI) was defined as the number of days from the date of the diagnostic mammogram to the date of the final diagnosis. RESULTS: Compared to the pre-pandemic group (n = 64), the pandemic group (n = 77) showed a reduction in DI of the entire cohort (pandemic: 1 day; pre-pandemic: 15 days, p < 0.0001) for patients not requiring tissue sampling (pandemic: 1 day; pre-pandemic: 11 days, .p < 0.0001) and those requiring tissue sampling with benign pathology (pandemic 9 days; pre-pandemic, 33 days, p = 0.0002). A higher percentage of patients in the pandemic group had their assessment completed during the initial visit (pandemic: 50.6%; pre-pandemic: 23.4%, p = 0.0009). CONCLUSION: During the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic, the DI for patients with non-screening-related diagnostic mammography was significantly shorter, with a higher percentage of patients completing their assessments on the initial visit, compared to one year prior. KEY POINTS: â¢ Despite reductions in manpower and clinical services, during pandemic times, it is possible to maintain a diagnostic breast imaging service for women at high clinical suspicion for breast cancer. â¢ During pandemic times, breast imaging departments should consider restructuring to a Rapid Diagnostic Unit model with a navigation team that follows patients through the assessment process to a final diagnosis. â¢ Departmental restructuring and patient navigation during pandemic times could either maintain or shorten the diagnostic interval for patients presenting for diagnostic mammography.",2021,"Crivellaro, Priscila; Tafur, Monica; George, Ralph; Muradali, Derek",Eur. radiol,,#covidwho-1274819,,,,,235466930.0

In the Canadian Veklury® monograph, it is mentioned that current non-clinical and clinical data do not suggest a risk of QT prolongation, but QT prolongation has not been fully evaluated in humans. Interestingly, in a recent small series of 67 patients treated with remdesivir alone daily (200 mg Day 1, 100 mg Days 2-7); although no instance of torsades de pointes was reported, there was a mean 24.4-ms increase in the QTc, with 9% of all QTc ≥ 500 ms and 9% of all DQTc ≥ 60 ms. Our aim was therefore to further evaluate the effects of remdesivir on cardiac electrophysiology. METHODS AND RESULTS 1) Ex vivo Langendorff retroperfusion experiments: Isolated hearts from male Hartley guinea pigs were either let at their natural sinus rhythm (SR) or paced at basic cycle lengths (BCL) of 250 or 200 ms. They were allowed to stabilize and were then exposed for 15 minutes to either remdesivir 3 (n=7), 10 (n=7) or 30 (n=5) µmol/L to assess drug-induced effect on monophasic action potential duration measured at 90% repolarization (MAPD90). 2) In vivo wireless cardiac telemetry experiments: Guinea pigs (n=3) implanted with radio transmitters were administered i.p. daily doses of remdesivir (5 mg/kg on Day 1 and 2.5 mg/kg on Days 2-10) and continuous ECG recordings were made. Results: See Tables. CONCLUSION Previous clinical studies have shown peak plasma concentrations of remdesivir in the 5-10 µmol/L range after the 200 mg Day 1 dose. In the present study, remdesivir had hardly any significant ex vivo effect on MAPD90 at clinically relevant concentrations (3-30 µmol/L). However, in vivo, the drug caused significant prolongation of the QT at Day 1 and Day 10 and of QTcF at Day 10. Interestingly, a trend toward bradycardia was observed in vivo after each administration of remdesivir. More in vivo experiments are therefore required to rule out any QTc-prolonging effects of remdesivir at clinically recommended dosage.",2021-10-31,"Pilote, S; Simard, C; Drolet, B",Canadian Journal of Cardiology,,,,,,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0828282X2100492X; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0828282X2100492X,239020866.0

This prompted research into the preparedness of librarians, librarianship students, and other students in 50 higher education institutions in Nigeria. Social survey was carried out by using social media platforms-WhatsApp and Facebook-to administer questionnaires to the target group. Responses revealed that librarians were not emotionally prepared for the pandemic and would prefer not to witness another. The use of libraries during the pandemic was minimal, and the availability of online resources was undermined by poor infrastructural development.

Although these trials can offer significant advantages over traditional clinical trials, the process of designing and implementing direct-to-family studies is poorly defined, especially in children with rheumatic disease. This paper provides lessons learnt from the design and implementation of a self-controlled, direct-to-family pilot trial aimed to evaluate the effects of a medication management device on adherence to hydroxychloroquine in paediatric SLE. METHODS: Several design features accommodate a direct-to-family approach. Participants meeting eligibility criteria from across the USA were identified a priori through a disease registry, and all outcome data are collected remotely. The primary outcome (medication adherence) is evaluated using electronic medication event-monitoring, plasma drug levels, patient questionnaires and pill counts. Secondary and exploratory endpoints include (1) lupus disease activity measured by a remote SLE Disease Activity Index examination and the Systemic Lupus Activity Questionnaire; and (2) hydroxychloroquine pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics. Recruitment of the initial target of 20 participants was achieved within 10 days. Due to initial recruitment success, enrolment was increased to 26 participants. Additional participants who were interested were placed on a waiting list in case of dropouts during the study. DISCUSSION AND DISSEMINATION: Direct-to-family trials offer several advantages but present unique challenges. Lessons learnt from the protocol development, design, and implementation of this trial will inform future direct-to-family trials for children and adults with rheumatic diseases. Additionally, the data collected remotely in this trial will provide critical information regarding the accuracy of teleresearch in lupus, the impact of adherence to hydroxychloroquine on disease activity and a pharmacokinetic analysis to inform paediatric-specific dosing of hydroxychloroquine.

RESULTS: Median numbers of epilepsy clinic visits conducted during the COVID-19 period (27.5 new and 113 follow up) remained similar to the median uptake during the pre-COVID period (28 new and 116 follow up). Prior experience with e-visits for epilepsy yielded smooth transition into the pandemic period, with several other advantages. The majority of eVisits were successful despite technical difficulties and major components of history and management were still easily implemented. Results from patient surveys supported that a significant amount of time and money were saved, which was in keeping with our health-economic analysis.

Yet, by many accounts, a nutritious diet has been a casualty of the pandemic, rather than a means to fight it, especially among the most socioeconomically vulnerable. Methods: We employed a cross-sectional design to examine income-based dietary disparities targeting young adults (ages 18-28) during the COVID-19 lockdown period. Young adults have experienced some of the biggest pandemic-related disruptions during a formative stage of development while no known scholarly attention has addressed dietary changes in this demographic. Participants (N=254) responded to a 15-20-minute online survey and questions related to food composition and sources of food, perceptions of healthy eating, weight change, physical activity, and food insecurity. Comparisons were made between those who lived in households that earned above versus below the U.S. median income. Results: : Lower income young adults were disproportionately represented in unhealthy consumption changes during the lockdown period such as increased intake of junk food (+3%) and a decrease in grains (-2%). Upper income participants were overly represented in healthy changes in diet such as a decrease in eating at fast food restaurants (-4%) and an increased reliance on home cooked food from scratch (+6%). Lower income participants also perceived their eating habits during the lockdown as less healthy (M=21.0, SD=4.99) than their upper income counterparts (M=23.53, SD=5.66). Weight gain during lockdown was reported by half (50%) of lower income and less than a third (29%) of upper income participants. Financial circumstances negatively impacted the diets of significantly more lower income (39%) than upper income (18%) respondents. Food insecurity during lockdown was a regular occurrence for 6-8% of lower income versus 2-5% of upper income young adults in this study. Conclusions: It is recommended that pandemic minded public health interventions account for negative dietary trends with particular attention to low-income young adults.",2022,"Parker, Jennifer Kaur Simranpreet Medalla John Marlo Imbert-Sanchez Anairobi Bautista Jeanette Alexandra",,,#ppcovidwho-330282,,,,https://doi.org/10.21203/rs.3.rs-736993/v1,247455686.0

METHODS: A sample of 512 (62.5% women; M (age) = 22.12 years, SD = 2.47) Chinese college students participated in this study from 24 March to 1 April 2020 via online questionnaire. They completed measures of social media use, the COVID‐19 stressor, negative affect, secondary traumatic stress (STS), depression, and anxiety as well as covariates. RESULTS: As expected, results from regression analyses indicated that a higher level of social media use was associated with worse mental health. More exposure to disaster news via social media was associated with greater depression for participants with high (but not low) levels of the disaster stressor. Moreover, path analysis showed negative affect mediated the relationship of social media use and mental health. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that the disaster stressor may be a risk factor that amplifies the deleterious impact of social media use on depression. In addition, excessive exposure to disaster on social media may trigger negative affect, which may in turn contribute to mental health problems.

To support the clinical development of each of these vaccine candidates, preclinical studies were performed to screen for potential toxicities (intrinsic and immunotoxicities). All treatment-related toxicities identified in these repeated-dose toxicology studies have been confined primarily to the sites of injection and seem to be the result of both the delivery method (as they are seen in both control and treated animals) and the intended immune response to the vaccine (as they occur with greater frequency and severity in treated animals). Reactogenicity at the site of injection is generally seen to be reversible as the frequency and severity diminished between doses and between the immediate and recovery termination time points. This observation also correlated with the biodistribution data reported in the companion article (Sheets et al., 2006), in which DNA plasmid vaccine was shown to remain at the site of injection, rather than biodistributing widely, and to clear over time. The results of these safety studies have been submitted to the Food and Drug Administration to support the safety of initiating clinical studies with these and related DNA plasmid vaccines. Thus far, standard repeated-dose toxicology studies have not identified any target organs for toxicity (other than the injection site) for our DNA plasmid vaccines at doses up to 8 mg per immunization, regardless of disease indication (i.e., expressed gene-insert) and despite differences (strengths) in the promoters used to drive this expression. As clinical data accumulate with these products, it will be possible to retrospectively compare the safety profiles of the products in the clinic to the results of the repeated-dose toxicology studies, in order to determine the utility of such toxicology studies for signaling potential immunotoxicities or intrinsic toxicities from DNA vaccines. These data build on the biodistribution studies performed (see companion article, Sheets et al., 2006) to demonstrate the safety and suitability for investigational human use of DNA plasmid vaccine candidates for a variety of infectious disease prevention indications.",2006,"Sheets, Rebecca L; Stein, Judith; Manetz, T Scott; Andrews, Charla; Bailer, Robert; Rathmann, John; Gomez, Phillip L",Toxicological sciences : an official journal of the Society of Toxicology,,,,,,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16569728/,2547187.0

Due to disparate national regulations on various ethical aspects, such as informed consent, there is the risk of ethical compromises when involving human subjects in research. Although the Declaration of Helsinki is the point of reference for ethical conduct of research on humans, national normative requirements may diverge from its provisions. The aim of this research is to examine requirements on informed consent in biomedical research in Germany, Poland, and Russia to determine how each national regulatory framework relates to the provisions of the Declaration of Helsinki. METHODS: For this analysis, we conducted a search of the legal databases “Gesetze im Internet” for Germany, “Internetowy System Aktow Prawnych” for Poland, and “ГAPAHT – Garant” for Russia. The search was complemented by a review of secondary literature contained in the databases Google Scholar, PubMed, Polish National Library, and eLibrary.ru. We have identified 21 normative regulations containing provisions on informed consent in clinical research in all three countries. The content of these documents was systematically categorized and analyzed. RESULTS: The normative framework in all three countries shows a strong commitment towards the core ethical principles of research envisaged in the Declaration of Helsinki. Nevertheless, provisions on informed consent vary between these three countries. The differences range from the method and language in which information should be provided, through the amount of information required to be disclosed, to the form of documenting consent or withdrawal. In the case of research on vulnerable groups, these differences are particularly visible. CONCLUSIONS: The identified differences can negatively impact the ethical conduct of international clinical studies. Attention needs to be paid that flexibilities within national regulations are not misused to undermine the protection of research subjects. Achieving global or regional legislative harmonization might prove impossible. Such lack of legal consensus reinforces the significance of the international ethical agreements.

However, other manifestations such as headache, abdominal pain, diarrhea, loss of taste and smell were added to the clinical spectrum, during the course of the COVID-19 pandemic. The reports on the neurological findings are increasing rapidly and headache seems to be the leader on the symptom list. Headache was reported in 11%-34% of the hospitalized COVID-19 patients, but clinical features of these headaches were totally missing in available publications. According to our initial experience, significant features of headache presentation in the symptomatic COVID-19 patients were new-onset, moderate-severe, bilateral headache with pulsating or pressing quality in the temporoparietal, forehead or periorbital region. The most striking features of the headache were sudden to gradual onset and poor response to common analgesics, or high relapse rate, that was limited to the active phase of the COVID-19. Symptomatic COVID-19 patients, around 6%-10%, also reported headache as a presenting symptom. The possible pathophysiological mechanisms of headache include activation of peripheral trigeminal nerve endings by the SARS-CoV-2 directly or through the vasculopathy and/or increased circulating pro-inflammatory cytokines and hypoxia. We concluded that as a common non-respiratory symptom of COVID-19, headache should not be overlooked, and its characteristics should be recorded with scrutiny.",2020,"Bolay, Hayrunnisa; Gül, Ahmet; Baykan, Betül",Headache,,#273657,,,,,218646796.0

According to the Brazilian Intensive Care Medicine Association, we correlated the data for adult intensive care unit beds in each state with the number of professionals for each ten intensive care unit beds. The number of professionals, beds, and cases were then organized by state. Results The number of physicians per 100 thousand inhabitants followed the World Health Organization recommendations;however, the number of nurses did not. The number of intensivists, registered nurses, nurse technicians specialized in intensive care, and respiratory therapists, necessary for every ten intensive care beds, was not enough for any of these professional categories.

However, nonstandard conditions necessitate the use of subjective correction factors or preclude the use of Henssge's nomogram altogether. To address this, we developed a powerful method for early PMI reconstruction using skin thermometry in conjunction with a comprehensive thermodynamic finite-difference model, which we validated using deceased human bodies. PMIs reconstructed using this approach, on average, deviated no more than ±38 minutes from their corresponding true PMIs (which ranged from 5 to 50 hours), significantly improving on the ±3 to ±7 hours uncertainty of the gold standard.

First efficacy data have been recently reported in COVID-19 patients. METHODS: We here report on the combined antiviral effect of both drugs in a SARS-CoV-2 Syrian hamster infection model. The infected hamsters were treated twice daily with the vehicle (the control group) or a suboptimal dose of each compound or a combination of both compounds. FINDINGS: When animals were treated with a combination of suboptimal doses of Molnupiravir and Favipiravir at the time of infection, a marked combined potency at endpoint is observed. Infectious virus titers in the lungs of animals treated with the combination are reduced by ∼5 log10 and infectious virus are no longer detected in the lungs of >60% of treated animals. When start of treatment was delayed with one day a reduction of titers in the lungs of 2.4 log10 was achieved. Moreover, treatment of infected animals nearly completely prevented transmission to co-housed untreated sentinels. Both drugs result in an increased mutation frequency of the remaining viral RNA recovered from the lungs of treated animals. In the combo-treated hamsters, an increased frequency of C-to-T mutations in the viral RNA is observed as compared to the single treatment groups which may explain the pronounced antiviral potency of the combination. Interpretation: Our findings may lay the basis for the design of clinical studies to test the efficacy of the combination of Molnupiravir/Favipiravir in the treatment of COVID-19.

Nous décrivons ici les symptômes et leur persistance dans une cohorte de patients ambulatoires COVID-19. Matériels et méthodes Notre hôpital universitaire a utilisé un logiciel de télémédecine (MH LINK) comme moyen de surveillance des patients ambulatoires atteints de la COVID-19. Nous avons suivi grâce à ce logiciel 129 patients avec un diagnostic de la COVID-19 confirmé par prélèvement PCR nasopharyngé entre le 29/022020 et le 18/05/2020. Des auto-questionnaires ont été remplis en ligne, après recueil des antécédents et des données sociodémographiques, pour surveiller la survenue de symptômes respiratoires (fréquence respiratoire, température, essoufflement au repos, essoufflement à l’effort, fatigue, goût, odorat, mal de gorge, douleur thoracique et brûlure thoracique). Résultats La population décrite était de 87 femmes (67 %) et 42 hommes (33 %), avec une médiane d’âge de 42,2 ans. Vingt-huit personnes (24 %) étaient en surpoids dont 19 (16 %) obèses (IMC&gt;30), 15 (11,6 %) étaient immunodéprimés, 20 (15,5 %) avaient des troubles respiratoires chroniques préexistants, 3 (2,3 %) des antécédents cardiovasculaires, 5 étaient diabétiques, 12 avaient une hypertension artérielle et 2 une dyslipidémie.

We compared sources and levels of stress, distress, and approaches to coping between nurses and physicians, and examined whether coping strategies helped mitigate the negative impact of stress and intentions to quit. METHODS Using a cross-sectional study design, burnout was measured with the Maslach Burnout Inventory. Psychological distress was measured using the Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Scale. A self-reported survey was used to evaluate stressors, impact on perceived performance, and intentions to quit. The data were analyzed using t-tests and linear regression models. RESULTS Responses of 119 HCPs were analyzed. Findings suggest that (1) compared to physicians, nurses experienced a higher level of distress and burnout, and used more maladaptive coping strategies. (2) Both nurses and physicians experienced more distress and burnout during COVID-19 than before. (3) Adaptive coping strategies moderated the negative impact of stress on work performance (4) Adaptive coping strategies moderated the negative effect of stress on burnout, which in turn reduced intentions to quit. Stress negatively impacted work performance and burnout only for those with low, but not high, levels of adaptive coping strategies. DISCUSSION The current findings of HCPs' challenges, risks, and protective factors provide valuable information (1) on COVID-19's impact on HCPs, (2) to guide the distribution of institutional supportive efforts and recommend adaptive coping strategies, and (3) to inform medical education, such as resilience training, focusing on adaptive coping approaches.",2021-05-10,"Lou, Nigel Mantou; Montreuil, Tina; Feldman, Liane S; Fried, Gerald M; Lavoie-Tremblay, Mélanie; Bhanji, Farhan; Kennedy, Heather; Kaneva, Pepa; Harley, Jason M",The Journal of continuing education in the health professions,,,,,,https://doi.org/10.1097/ceh.0000000000000365; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33973927/,234360031.0

However, inconsistency in the nomenclature limits uniformity in its epidemiological understanding. This study provides an integration of existing classifications and describes evolutionary trends of the SARS-CoV-2 strains circulating in India. Methods: The whole genomes of 330 SARS-CoV-2 samples were sequenced using next-generation sequencing (NGS). Phylogenetic and sequence analysis of a total of 3014 Indian SARS-CoV-2 sequences from 20 different States/Union Territories (January to September 2020) from the Global Initiative on Sharing All Influenza Data (GISAID) database was performed to observe the clustering of Nextstrain and Phylogenetic Assignment of Named Global Outbreak LINeages (Pangolin) lineages with the GISAID clades. The identification of mutational sites under selection pressure was performed using Mixed Effects Model of Evolution and Single-Likelihood Ancestor Counting methods available in the Datamonkey server. Results: Temporal data of the Indian SARS-CoV-2 genomes revealed that except for Uttarakhand, West Bengal and Haryana that showed the circulation of GISAID clade O even after July 2020, the rest of the States showed a complete switch to GR/GH clades. Pangolin lineages B.1.1.8 and B.1.113 identified within GR and GH clades, respectively, were noted to be indigenous evolutions. Sites identified to be under positive selection pressure within these clades were found to occur majorly in the non-structural proteins coded by ORF1a and ORF1b. Interpretation & conclusions: This study interpreted the geographical and temporal dominance of SARS-CoV-2 strains in India over a period of nine months based on the GISAID classification. An integration of the GISAID, Nextstrain and Pangolin classifications is also provided. The emergence of new lineages B.1.1.8 and B.1.113 was indicative of host-specific evolution of the SARS-CoV-2 strains in India.

Because sleep is one of the endogenous drives that impacts short and long-term health and well-being, it is important to consider how social isolation during the COVID-19 government-mandated quarantines affected sleep and sleep habits. A number of researchers have addressed this question during the last 2 years by examining several concepts related to possible changes in sleep during the quarantines. To best understand these recent results, the current mini review provides a background on the pre-pandemic literature on the effects of social isolation and loneliness with a focus on sleep and then summarizes the recent literature on sleep and sleep habits. In general, sleep was negatively impacted for many people during the pandemics but not all. One group that seemed to benefit from the pandemic in terms of sleep patterns, were younger people who could more easily adapt their sleep times to match their internal chronobiology. Given the potential broad impact of sleep on health and well-being, better understanding how social isolation impacts sleep is an important consideration for individuals, work organizations, and governments.",2021,"Pilcher, June J.; Dorsey, Logan L.; Galloway, Samantha M.; Erikson, Dylan N.",Frontiers in psychology,,#covidwho-1647676,,,,,245828618.0

Yet, disparities in cancer outcomes remain. Underserved populations continue to experience an excessive cancer burden. This burden is largely explained by health care disparities, lifestyle factors, cultural barriers, and disparate exposures to carcinogens and pathogens, as exemplified by the COVID-19 epidemic. However, research also shows that comorbidities, social stress, ancestral and immunobiological factors, and the microbiome, may contribute to health disparities in cancer risk and survival. Recent studies revealed that comorbid conditions can induce an adverse tumor biology, leading to a more aggressive disease and decreased patient survival.

This “cool off” strategy is intended to facilitate the safe completion of a one-stage resection using a minimally invasive approach and minimize perioperative complications. There is limited data evaluating the benefits of delayed versus early resection. METHODS: A retrospective review of a prospectively maintained inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) database at a tertiary center was queried from 2013–2020 to identify patients who underwent ICR for complicated ileal CD confirmed on preoperative imaging. ICR cohorts were classified as early (≤ 7 days) vs delayed (> 7 days) based on the interval from diagnostic imaging to surgery. Operative approach and 30-day postoperative morbidity were analyzed. RESULTS: Out of 474 patients who underwent ICR over the 7-year period, 112 patients had complicated ileal CD including 99 patients (88%) with intraabdominal abscess. Early ICR was performed in 52 patients (46%) at a median of 3 days (IQR 2, 5) from diagnostic imaging. Delayed ICR was performed in 60 patients (54%) following a median “cool off” period of 23 days of non-operative treatment (IQR 14, 44), including preoperative percutaneous abscess drainage in 17 patients (28%). A higher proportion of patients with intraabdominal abscess underwent delayed vs early ICR (57% vs 43%, p = 0.19). Overall, there were no significant differences in the rate of laparoscopy (96% vs 90%), conversion to open surgery (12% vs 17%), rates of extended bowel resection (8% vs 13%), additional concurrent procedures (44% vs 52%), or fecal diversion (10% vs 2%) in the early vs delayed ICR groups. The median postoperative length of stay was 5 days in both groups with an overall 25% vs 17% (p = 0.39) 30-day postoperative complication rate and a 6% vs 5% 30-day readmission rate in early vs delayed ICR groups, respectively. Overall median follow-up time was 14.3 months (IQR 1.2, 24.1) with no difference in the rate of subsequent CD-related intestinal resection (4% vs 5%) between the two groups.

This disease should be viewed as a public health problem with a major effect on the quality of life of women as well as being a substantial economic burden. In light of the considerable progress with diagnostic imaging (for example, transvaginal ultrasound and MRI), exploratory laparoscopy should no longer be used to diagnose endometriotic lesions. Instead, diagnosis of endometriosis should be based on a structured process involving the combination of patient interviews, clinical examination and imaging. Notably, a diagnosis of endometriosis often leads to immediate surgery. Therefore, rethinking the diagnosis and management of endometriosis is warranted. Instead of assessing endometriosis on the day of the diagnosis, gynaecologists should consider the patient's 'endometriosis life'. Medical treatment is the first-line therapeutic option for patients with pelvic pain and no desire for immediate pregnancy. In women with infertility, careful consideration should be made regarding whether to provide assisted reproductive technologies prior to performing endometriosis surgery.

The International Code of Marketing of Breastmilk Substitutes is an internationally agreed code of practice, adopted by the World Health Assembly in 1981, to regulate promotion of commercial formula, and is supported by legislation in many countries. However, marketing of formula remains widespread and contributes to mother’s decisions to formula feed. We present South African data from a multi-country, mixed-methods study exploring women’s decision-making about infant feeding and how this was influenced by exposure to formula marketing. METHODS: Using a consumer-based marketing approach, focus group discussions (FGDs) were conducted with pregnant women and mothers of children aged between 0 and 18 months in two urban sites in South Africa. Participants were purposively selected according to their child’s age, infant feeding practices and socioeconomic status. Ten FGDs were conducted during February 2020 with a total of 69 participants. Thematic analysis was used to analyse the data with NVivo v.12 software. RESULTS: Despite being encouraged by health professionals to breastfeed and intending to do so, many mothers chose to give formula in the early weeks and months of their child’s life. Mothers reported breastfeeding challenges as the most frequent reason for initiating infant formula, stating that family members and health professionals recommended formula to solve these challenges. Although participants described few advertisements for infant formula, advertisements for ‘growing-up’ formulas for older children were widespread and promoted brand recognition. Mothers experienced other marketing approaches including attractive packaging and shop displays of infant formula, and obtained information from social media and online mothers’ groups, which influenced their choice of formula brand. Mothers reported strong brand loyalty derived from previous experiences and recommendations. Health professionals frequently recommended formula, including recommending specific formula brands and specialist formulas. CONCLUSION: Global formula companies use multifaceted marketing methods to promote a strong narrative portraying formula feeding as a positive lifestyle choice. Positive, coordinated efforts are required to counter pro-formula messaging and change the narrative to support breastfeeding as an aspirational choice. In particular, health professionals must stop supporting the formula industry.

METHODS: Using cross-sectional data from the Canadian Perspectives Survey Series, collected between March 29 and April 3, 2020, among Canadian adults (N=4455), we assessed prevalence of not working from home, social distancing in public, or practicing frequent handwashing, according to age, sex, marital status, immigration, education, chronic disease presence, and source of COVID-19 information. Multivariate regression, population attributable fraction estimation, and generalized product mediation analysis were applied. RESULTS: Absence of frequent handwashing and distancing was more common among those working outside than within the home (prevalence differences of 7% (95% CI: 4, 10) and 7% (95% CI: 3, 10), respectively). Inequalities in handwashing and distancing were observed across education and immigration status. Over 40% of the prevalence of non-uptake of handwashing and distancing was attributable to populations not being able to work from home. If all worked from home, over 40% (95% CI: 8, 70) of education-based inequalities in handwashing and distancing could be eliminated, but differences by immigration status would likely remain. CONCLUSION: For pandemic response, both workplace safety initiatives and mechanisms to address the inequitable distribution of health risks across socio-economic groups are needed to reduce broader inequalities in transmission risk.

Para tal, realizouse três experimentos a partir de três dietas contendo milho, quirera de arroz ou sorgo. No primeiro estudo, 375 juvenis, com 12,13±0,09 g foram distribuídos em 15 tanques (280L), alimentados com dieta extrusada, três vezes ao dia, até saciedade, por 60 dias. O delineamento foi o inteiramente casualizado com três tratamentos e cinco repetições. Os resultados obtidos foram submetidos a ANOVA e as médias comparadas pelo teste de Duncan (5%). No segundo estudo, animais foram submetidos à avaliação da glicemia pós-prandial, portanto, permaneceram 12 horas em jejum. A colheita do sangue ocorreu no tempo zero (antes da realimentação) e 1, 3, 6, 9 e 12 horas pós-alimentação. No terceiro estudo, 100 animais com 56,32±0,85g foram utilizados para determinar a digestibilidade das dietas experimentais em quatro tanques cilíndricos de fundo cônico (190 L), para decantação das fezes. Realizou-se a coleta de uma dieta por vez, com quatro repetições. Não houve mortalidade; o peso final, ganho de peso, ganho médio diário, ganho em peso relativo, fator de condição, consumo alimentar, taxa de crescimento específico, comprimento total, conversão alimentar, triglicerídeos, lipoproteína de densidade muito baixa, alanina aminotransferase, coeficiente de retenção proteica e digestibilidade foram semelhantes entre as dietas (P > 0,05). Lipoproteínas de alta densidade, proteínas totais, globulinas, proteína hepática, amônia hepática, glicose hepática, glicogênio hepático, proteína corporal, rendimento de carcaça foram mais elevados com o uso de sorgo (P < 0,05). A lipoproteína de baixa densidade foi maior quando do fornecimento de milho. A glicose plasmática foi mais elevada nos tratamentos com milho e quirera de arroz. O uso de sorgo levou a menores valores de índices hepatossomáticos, gordura visceral, digestivossomático, albumina, colesterol e quociente intestinal. As enzimas amilase, lipase, tripsina e maltase reduziram suas atividades nos animas alimentados com a dieta com sorgo. A dieta com quirera de arroz resultou em maiores teores de lipídios, coeficiente de retenção lipídica, aminoácidos livre no fígado, amônia hepática e glicose hepática. Para matéria seca, proteína e cinzas não houve diferença. Na curva glicêmica, verificou-se picos de glicemia com 3,5 e 4 horas após ingestão das dietas contendo sorgo e arroz, respectivamente, enquanto para o milho o maior valor foi após 12 horas da alimentação. A digestibilidade da matéria seca, proteína e lipídios não diferiu entre os tratamentos. Por conseguinte, os estudos demonstraram que milho, quirera de arroz ou sorgo na dieta de juvenis de pacu são adequadamente utilizadas pela espécie, sem qualquer efeito adverso sobre o crescimento e sobrevivência. O milho denota um perfil metabólico de melhor aproveitamento dos carboidratos da dieta. A quirera de arroz e sorgo geram aumento no catabolismo de aminoácidos para manter os processos de produção de energia. Há aumento de produção de compostos nitrogenados de excreção tanto nos tratamentos com quirera quanto sorgo.

School absenteeism data have been employed as a component of influenza surveillance systems in some locations. Data timeliness and system acceptance remain as key determinants affecting the usefulness of a prospective surveillance system. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to assess the feasibility of implementing an electronic school absenteeism surveillance system using smart card–based technology for influenza-like illness (ILI) surveillance among a representative network of local primary and secondary schools in Hong Kong. METHODS: We designed and implemented a surveillance system according to the Protocol for a Standardized information infrastructure for Pandemic and Emerging infectious disease Response (PROSPER). We employed an existing smart card–based education and school administration platform for data capture, customized the user interface, and used additional back end systems built for other downstream surveillance steps. We invited local schools to participate and collected absenteeism data by the implemented system. We compared temporal trend of the absenteeism data with data from existing community sentinel and laboratory surveillance data. RESULTS: We designed and implemented an ILI surveillance system utilizing smart card–based attendance tracking approach for data capture. We implemented the surveillance system in a total of 107 schools (including 66 primary schools and 41 secondary schools), covering a total of 75,052 children. The system successfully captured information on absences for 2 consecutive academic years (2012-2013 and 2013-2014). The absenteeism data we collected from the system reflected ILI activity in the community, with an upsurge in disease activity detected up to 1 to 2 weeks preceding other existing surveillance systems. CONCLUSIONS: We designed and implemented a novel smart card technology–based school absenteeism surveillance system. Our study demonstrated the feasibility of building a large-scale surveillance system riding on a routinely adopted data collection approach and the use of simple system enhancement to minimize workload implication and enhance system acceptability.

sxx3yid9,,Medline,Potent antifungal agents and use of nanocarriers to improve delivery to the infected site - a systematic review.,10.1002/jobm.202100204,,34351655,unk,"There are four major classes of antifungals with the predominant mechanism of action being targeting of cell wall or cell membrane. As in other drugs, low solubility of these compounds has led to low bioavailability in target tissues. Enhanced drug dosages has effects such as toxicity, drug-drug interactions and increased drug resistance by fungi. This article reviews current state-of-art of antifungals, structure, mechanism of action, other usages, and toxic side effects. The emergence of nanoformulations to transport and uniformly release cargo at the target site is a boon in antifungal treatment. The article details research that lead to the development of nanoformulations of antifungals and potential advantages and avoidance of the lacunae characterizing conventional drugs. A range of nanoformulations based on liposomes, polymers are in various stages of research and their potential advantages have been brought out. It could be observed that under similar dosages, test models and duration, nanoformulations provided enhanced activity, reduced toxicity, higher uptake and higher immunostimulatory effects. In most instances the mechanism of antifungal activity of nanoformulations were similar to that of regular antifungal. There are possibilities of coupling multiple antifungals on the same nano-platform. Increased activity coupled with multiple mechanisms of action presents for nanoformulations a tremendous opportunity to overcome antifungal resistance. In the years to come robust methods for preparation of nanoformulations taking into account the repeatability and reproducibility in action, furthering the studies on nanoformulation toxicity and studies of human models are required prior to extensive use of nanoformulations as a prescribed drug.

The disease (COVID-19) quickly spread around the globe, escalating to a global pandemic. In this review, we discuss the virological, immunological, and imaging approaches harnessed for COVID-19 diagnosis and research. COVID-19 shares many clinical characteristics with other respiratory illnesses.Accurate and early detection of the infection is pivotal to controlling the outbreak, as this enables case identification, isolation, and contact tracing. We summarize the available literature on current laboratory and point-of-care diagnostics, highlight their strengths and limitations, and describe the emerging diagnostic approaches on the horizon.We also discuss the various research techniques that are being used to evaluate host immunity in laboratory-confirmed patients. Additionally, pathological imaging of tissue samples from affected patients has a critical role in guiding investigations on this disease. Conventional techniques, such as immunohistochemistry and immunofluorescence, have been frequently used to characterize the immune microenvironment in COVID-19. We also outline the emerging imaging techniques, such as the RNAscope, which might also aid in our understanding of the significance of COVID-19-specific biomarkers, such as the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) cellular receptor.Overall, great progress has been made in COVID-19 research in a short period.

While many SARS‐CoV‐2 RT‐qPCR tests are available, there are significant differences in test sensitivity, workflow (e.g. hands‐on‐time), gene targets and other functionalities that users must consider. Several publicly available protocols shared by reference labs and public health authorities provide useful tools for SARS‐CoV‐2 diagnosis, but many have shortcomings related to sensitivity and laborious workflows. Here, we describe a series of SARS‐CoV‐2 RT‐qPCR tests that are originally based on the protocol targeting regions of the RNA‐dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) and envelope (E) coding genes developed by the Charité Berlin. We redesigned the primers/probes, utilized locked nucleic acid nucleotides, incorporated dual probe technology and conducted extensive optimizations of reaction conditions to enhance the sensitivity and specificity of these tests. By incorporating an RNase P internal control and developing multiplexed assays for distinguishing SARS‐CoV‐2 and influenza A and B, we streamlined the workflow to provide quicker results and reduced consumable costs. Some of these tests use modified enzymes enabling the formulation of a room temperature‐stable master mix and lyophilized positive control, thus increasing the functionality of the test and eliminating cold chain shipping and storage. Moreover, a rapid, RNA extraction‐free version enables high sensitivity detection of SARS‐CoV‐2 in about an hour using minimally invasive, self‐collected gargle samples.

Design: A three-wave longitudinal survey design. Methods: Australian and US residents (N = 601) completed self-report measures of social cognition constructs (attitude, subjective norm, moral norm, perceived behavioral control [PBC]), intention, habit, and physical distancing behavior on an initial occasion (T1) and on two further occasions one week (T2) and four months (T3) later. Results: A structural equation model revealed that subjective norm, moral norm, and PBC, were consistent predictors of physical distancing intention on all three occasions. Intention and habit at T1 and T2 predicted physical distancing behavior at T2 and T3, respectively. Intention at T2 mediated effects of subjective norm, moral norm, and PBC at T2 on physical distancing behavior at T3, and habit at T1 and T2 mediated effects of behavior at T1 and T2 on follow-up behavior at T2 and T3, respectively. Conclusion: Normative (subjective and moral norms) and capacity (PBC) constructs were consistent predictors of physical distancing intention, and intention and habit were consistent predictors of physical distancing behavior.

However, caregivers may be or feel unable to cope with their role and, despite the needs of caregivers are often assessed in the literature, their opinions and feelings about these needs are not widely explored yet. This study aimed at exploring the opinions and feelings about their educational needs and role of familial caregivers of Parkinson's Disease patients. METHODS A qualitative study was conducted from October to December 2017 in a polyclinic of central Italy. Fourteen caregivers voluntarily participated in the study; semi-structured face-to-face interviews were conducted, and audio recorded until data saturation. Two investigators reviewed the transcribed notes, created Meaning Units, Sub-categories and finally the Categories with emerged themes. RESULTS The analysis of the 14 interviews generated three categories: supportiveness of healthcare educational programs; sense of inability to manage caregiver tasks; need for interaction with other familial caregivers. CONCLUSIONS The caregivers declared their belief that healthcare educational courses can be useful in helping them live and understand the caregiving tasks and expressed their need to share their experiences with other caregivers. In fact, they often they felt abandoned and poorly trained for the patient's management at the home.

We found that SARS-CoV-2 infection or glucotoxic condition increased the cellular secretion of GP73. Secreted GP73 trafficked to the liver and kidney to stimulate gluconeogenesis through cAMP/PKA pathway. By using global phosphoproteomics, we found a drastic remodeling of PKA kinase hub exerted by GP73. Notably, COVID-19 patients showed pathologically elevated plasma GP73, and neutralization of the secreted GP73 inhibited enhanced PKA signaling and glucose production associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection.

Roux-en-Y (RY) is the most common reconstruction method following total gastrectomy. Trials to explore other means of reconstruction have been conducted but have failed to identify a method that is globally accepted. METHODS Aboral pouch reconstruction (AP), in which an anisoperistaltic jejunal pouch is created in the Y limb of the RY reconstruction, is considered effective and technically feasible. A prospective randomized trial was conducted to compare AP with RY. Gastric cancer patients requiring total gastrectomy for R0 resection were randomly assigned during surgery to receive either RY (n = 51) or AP (n = 49). Postoperative QOL as assessed by the EORTC QLQ-C30 and STO22, body composition, and morbidity were compared between the two reconstruction methods. The physical functioning score of the QLQ-C30 was selected as the primary endpoint. RESULTS The incidences of postoperative complications were similar between the two groups (29 % in the RY group and 27 % in the AP group). No significant difference was observed in the physical functioning score, and the superiority of AP was demonstrated only for the nausea and vomiting score at 12 months (p = 0.041) and the reflux score at 1 month (p = 0.036).

Since then, the disease has been reclassified, the specialty of paediatric rheumatology has evolved, and there has been a significant shift in disease management with new advanced therapies. This study aimed to provide up to date national estimates of this disease. METHODS Children and young people (CYP) with JIA were identified in the Clinical Practice Research Datalink (CPRD) GOLD and Aurum databases, which source data from the two most commonly used primary care electronic health record systems in the UK. These databases were combined, and the cohort was identified 2000-2018 using pre-defined codelists. Validation was performed through linkage to the England Hospital Episode Statistics. Annual incidence and prevalence rates were calculated and stratified by gender, age group and nation of the UK. Direct standardisation to UK population was performed, and 5 year incidence rates calculated between 2003 and 2018. RESULTS The age standardised incidence rate was 5.61 per 100 000 population. The age standardised prevalence rate in 2018 was 43.5 per 100 000. Rates were higher in Scotland compared with England: incidence rate ratio (95% CI) 1.27 (1.11-1.46). 5-year incidence rates did not change significantly over time.

When killed 72 h after infection, intestinal villi were shorter and crypts deeper (P less than 0.025) in duodenum, upper jejunum, and mid-small intestine, but not ileum in infected piglets. Virus antigen was seen by fluorescence microscopy in occasional jejunal villus tip cells in only four infected piglets and no controls at 72 h. Net Na+ and Cl- fluxes did not differ from noninfected litter-mate controls under basal conditions, but response to glucose was blunted in infected piglets (P less than 0.001). Theophylline stimulated net Cl- secretion in both infected and control animals, and cyclic AMP concentration in isolated jejunal villus enterocytes did not differ significantly. In isolated jejunal villus enterocytes of infected piglets, thymidine kinase activity increased (P less than 0.001), and sucrase activity decreased (P less than 0.001). We conclude that in this invasive enteritis caused by a major human viral pathogen, glucose-coupled Na+ transport is impaired in the jejunum at a time when the villus epithelium shows enzyme characteristics of crypt epithelium, and when little or no virus is present.

We aimed to provide substantial evidence for the effect of BNT162b2 mRNA vaccine versus native infection on maternal humoral, as well as transplacentally acquired fetal immune response, potentially providing newborn protection. Methods: A multicenter study where parturients presenting for delivery were recruited at 8 medical centers across Israel and assigned to three study groups: vaccinated (n=86); PCR confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infected during pregnancy (n=65), and unvaccinated non-infected controls (n=62). Maternal and fetal blood samples were collected from parturients prior to delivery and from the umbilical cord following delivery, respectively. Sera IgG and IgM titers were measured using Milliplex MAP SARS-CoV-2 Antigen Panel (for S1, S2, RBD and N). Results: BNT162b2 mRNA vaccine elicits strong maternal humoral IgG response (Anti-S and RBD) that crosses the placenta barrier and approaches maternal titers in the fetus within 15 days following the first dose. Maternal to neonatal anti-COVID-19 antibodies ratio did not differ when comparing sensitization (vaccine vs. infection). IgG transfer rate was significantly lower for third-trimester as compared to second trimester infection. Lastly, fetal IgM response was detected in 5 neonates, all in the infected group.

Simple methods such as Akaike Information Criterion are commonly used but they do not incorporate the uncertainty of the model's parameters, which can give misleading choices when comparing models with similar fit to the data. One approach to model selection in a more rigorous way that uses the full posterior distributions of the models is to compute the ratio of the normalising constants (or model evidence), known as Bayes factors. These normalising constants integrate the posterior distribution over all parameters and balance over and under fitting. However, normalising constants often come in the form of intractable, high-dimensional integrals, therefore special probabilistic techniques need to be applied to correctly estimate the Bayes factors. One such method is thermodynamic integration (TI), which can be used to estimate the ratio of two models' evidence by integrating over a continuous path between the two un-normalised densities. In this paper we introduce a variation of the TI method, here referred to as referenced TI, which computes a single model's evidence in an efficient way by using a reference density such as a multivariate normal - where the normalising constant is known. We show that referenced TI, an asymptotically exact Monte Carlo method of calculating the normalising constant of a single model, in practice converges to the correct result much faster than other competing approaches such as the method of power posteriors. We illustrate the implementation of the algorithm on informative 1- and 2-dimensional examples, and apply it to a popular linear regression problem, and use it to select parameters for a model of the COVID-19 epidemic in South Korea.",2020-09-08,"Hawryluk, Iwona; Mishra, Swapnil; Flaxman, Seth; Bhatt, Samir; Mellan, Thomas A.",,,,2009.03851,document_parses/pdf_json/c114eba3ec2a09c6884fb3d2a25e123d8947e03f.json,,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2009.03851v2.pdf,221535100.0

Difficulties were encountered in collating precise, reliable and consistent data about the timing of the onset of COVID-19 and its peaks, the speed and intensity with which measures were implemented, and the strictness of their application. Some EU member states made recommendations and issued advice, others introduced restrictive measures progressively, while yet others declared an emergency and imposed a draconian lockdown with penalties for non-compliance. Various combinations of measures were introduced covering the banning of public events, social gatherings, internal and external travel, school and shop closures, and social distancing. Research institutions developed models for assessing the effectiveness of different measures in containing the disease, including a COVID-19 stringency index of government responses and lockdown rollback checklist. The analysis shows how, in many countries, the introduction of restrictive measures was less controversial than decisions about lifting or easing lockdown, as governments, ministers of finance and health grappled with conflicting interests, pressures and advice.",2021,"Hantrais, L.; Letablier, M.

In this study, we aimed to assess the pandemic's effect on women's COVID-19-related publishing over the first year of the pandemic. METHODS AND RESULTS: We compared the gender distribution of first authorships for 42 898 publications on COVID-19 from 1 February 2020 to 31 January 2021 to 483 232 publications appearing in the same journals during the same period the year prior. We found that the gender gap-the percentage of articles on which men versus women were first authors-widened by 14 percentage points during the COVID-19 pandemic, despite many pertinent research fields showing near equal proportions of men and women first authors publishing in the same fields before the pandemic. Longitudinal analyses revealed that the significant initial expansions of the gender gap began to trend backwards to expected values over time in many fields. As women may have been differentially affected depending on their geography, we also assessed the gender distribution of first authorships grouped by countries and geographical areas. While we observed a significant reduction of the shares of women first authors in almost all countries, longitudinal analyses confirmed a resolving trend over time. CONCLUSION: The reduction in women's COVID-19-related research output appears particularly concerning as many disciplines informing the response to the pandemic had near equal gender shares of first authorship in the year prior to the pandemic. The acute productivity drain with the onset of the pandemic magnifies deep-rooted obstacles on the way to gender equity in scientific contribution.",2021,"Lerchenmüller, Carolin; Schmallenbach, Leo; Jena, Anupam B; Lerchenmueller, Marc J",BMJ Open,,#1169876,,,,,233030183.0

They quickly turned to restrictions on the freedom of movement and assembly in the form of forced isolation, mandatory quarantines and lockdowns. Africa’s first confirmed case was not until 14 February in Egypt and March saw a steady spread of the virus throughout the African continent. Concern began to rise about the impact that the virus would have on a continent that is currently facing HIV and TB epidemics and sporadic outbreaks of Ebola and Lassa Fever. There were fears that the already weakened health systems in many African jurisdictions may be unable to cope with another pandemic and quick and decisive action to stop the spread of the virus was considered to be essential. On 15 March 2020, nine days after the first recorded case in South Africa, President Cyril Ramaphosa announced a State of Disaster. Over the following weeks, a series of regulations were promulgated that limited the freedom of movement and assembly, limited the sale of certain items, specifically prohibited the sale and transportation of alcohol and cigarettes and criminalised the spread of disinformation on COVID-19. Together they represent the greatest limits on the Bill of Rights in post-apartheid South Africa. However, public health strategies such as social distancing and regular hand washing are a privilege many in South Africa cannot afford, especially for thosein crowded informal settlements and who use mass public transport systems.

In pathologies with clinical characteristics similar to SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia, most patients showed cognitive deficits after discharge from ICU. In particular, previous studies describe impairment on verbal learning among PICS patients.ObjectivesTo analyse the immediate verbal-learning performance in patients with PICS after COVID-19 infection in a Functional Rehabilitation Unit in Madrid (Spain) using the Spanish version of the Screen for Cognitive Impairment in Psychiatry (SCIP-S).MethodsThis study was conducted in the Hospital Central de la Cruz Roja, in Madrid (Spain). A sample of 17 PICS adult patients was included, with age ranging from 56 to 74 years old (mean = 68.35 years;13 males). Patients were assessed around three weeks after referral from their reference hospital. The Verbal Learning Test-Immediate (VLT-I) of the SCIP-S was used as outcome. Descriptive analyses were conducted (mean and standard deviation) on standardized scores (z) based on age-adjusted general population norms.

METHODS: A questionnaire requesting general data, staff data and workload data of the centers was developed and sent by means of an online cloud-based software instrument to all Italian pediatric surgery Units. RESULTS: The survey was answered by 34 (65%) out of 52 centers. NICU bedside surgery is reported in 81.8% of the pediatric surgery centers. A lower prevalence of bedside surgical practice in the NICU was reported for Southern Italy and the islands than for Northern Italy and Central Italy (Southern <Northern<Central, p < 0.03). The most frequent clinical characteristics of neonates was preterm neonates with birthweight < 1200 g, with cardiorespiratory instability and/or ventilatory dependence. The most frequently selected indications to surgery were pneumothorax, pleural effusion, pericardial effusion, central venous catheter (CVC) positioning, intestinal perforation, patent ductus arteriosus ligation and congenital diaphragmatic hernia. More than 60% of respondents report no institutional recommendations and dedicated informed consent on bedside surgical procedures. The lack of dedicated areas and infrastructures is considered a relative contraindication to the performance of bedside surgery. CONCLUSION: Bedside surgery is performed in the majority of the Italian pediatric surgery centers included in this census. The introduction of a national set of surgery guidelines would be widely welcomed.",2020-09-16,"Pelizzo, Gloria; Bagolan, Pietro; Morini, Francesco; Aceti, Mariagrazia; Alberti, Daniele; Andermarcher, Mario; Avolio, Luigi; Bartoli, Fabio; Briganti, Vito; Cacciaguerra, Sebastiano; Camoglio, Francesco S.; Ceccarelli, Pierluca; Cheli, Maurizio; Chiarenza, Fabio; Ciardini, Enrico; Cimador, Marcello; Clemente, Ennio; Cozzi, Denis A.; Dall’ Oglio, Luigi; De Luca, Ugo; Del Rossi, Carmine; Esposito, Ciro; Falchetti, Diego; Federici, Silvana; Gamba, Piergiorgio; Gentilino, Valerio; Mattioli, Girolamo; Martino, Ascanio; Messina, Mario; Noccioli, Bruno; Inserra, Alessandro; Lelli Chiesa, Pierluigi; Leva, Ernesto; Licciardi, Francesco; Midrio, Paola; Nobili, Maria; Papparella, Alfonso; Paradies, Guglielmo; Piazza, Giuseppe; Pini Prato, Alessio; Rossi, Fabio; Riccipetitoni, Giovanna; Romeo, Carmelo; Salerno, Domenico; Settimi, Alessandro; Schleef, Jurgen; Milazzo, Mario; Calcaterra, Valeria; Lima, Mario",Ital J Pediatr,,,,document_parses/pdf_json/2ae34cfb88e8405f153d847a936e6b56f8f2dae0.json,document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7493058.xml.json,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7493058/,

Real-time population screening and identification of groups in whom positivity is highest could help monitor spread and inform public health messaging and strategy. MethodsTo develop a real-time screening process, we included results from nose and throat swabs and questionnaires taken 19 July 2020-17 July 2021 in the UKs national COVID-19 Infection Survey. Fortnightly, associations between SARS-CoV-2 positivity and 60 demographic and behavioural characteristics were estimated using logistic regression models adjusted for potential confounders, considering multiple testing, collinearity, and reverse causality. FindingsOf 4,091,537 RT-PCR results from 482,677 individuals, 29,903 (0{middle dot}73%) were positive. As positivity rose September-November 2020, rates were independently higher in younger ages, and those living in Northern England, major urban conurbations, more deprived areas, and larger households. Rates were also higher in those returning from abroad, and working in healthcare or outside of home. When positivity peaked December 2020-January 2021 (Alpha), high positivity shifted to southern geographical regions. With national vaccine roll-out from December 2020, positivity reduced in vaccinated individuals. Associations attenuated as rates decreased between February-May 2021. Rising positivity rates in June-July 2021 (Delta) were independently higher in younger, male, and unvaccinated groups. Few factors were consistently associated with positivity. 25/45 (56%) confirmed associations would have been detected later using 28-day rather than 14-day periods.

This study aimed to explore how widespread and severe moral distress is amongst intensive care professionals in the UK. Methods: Prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, a paper questionnaire that quantitatively assessed moral distress using the validated Measure of Moral Distress for Healthcare Professionals (MMD-HP) was distributed at four intensive care units of varying size and speciality facilities. Results: 227 questionnaires were returned, including 165 nurses and 40 doctors with a mean age and ICU experience of 38.1 and 10.1 years, respectively. The median moral distress score was 108 (IQR = 78.2, range 0 to 288). Moral distress was greatest in situations related to delivering aggressive treatment that was perceived as futile or not in the patient’s best interests, closely followed by situations related to lack of resources compromising care. Moral distress was independently influenced by profession ( p = 0.02) (nurses 117.0 vs doctors 78.0) and had no relationship with participant age and ICU experience. One-third indicated their intention to leave their current post due to moral distress and this was greater amongst nurses than doctors (37.0% vs 15.0%). Multiple logistic regression models included profession, gender, hospital type, age and ICU experience as covariates and had good discrimination and ability to predict intention to leave. Moral distress was associated with an intention to leave their current post in unadjusted and adjusted analyses (adjOR = 1.011 per 1 unit increase in moral distress, 1.006–1.017, p < 0.0001) and a previous post (adjOR = 1.009, 1.004–1.014, p = 0.001). Conclusions: Moral distress appears widespread amongst UK ICU professionals and is worse amongst nurses. Moral distress due to resource-related issues was more severe than comparable studies in North America. Its relationship with an intention to leave a post and the high proportion of ICU nurses considering leaving their current post due to moral distress is concerning, particularly as this study was performed prior to the COVID-19 pandemic.

A cross-sectional online survey was conducted among elementary and kindergarten school teachers in the area of Western Greece from June 2020 to August 2020. A self-administered questionnaire was distributed via an internet-based link along with an invitation e-mail. Responses from 399 participants were retrieved. 139 (34.8%) had received the annual influenza vaccine in the season 2019-2020, whereas 215 (53.9%) stated that they would get it in the forthcoming season 2020-2021 (p < .001). 152 (38.1%) intent to get the COVID-19 vaccine when available. For COVID-19 vaccine factors that were independently associated with the intention to uptake included more than 15 years at work (p = .001), prior influenza vaccine uptake (p = .003), believing that COVID-19 vaccine should be mandatory (p = .04) and that school teachers are a high-risk group for COVID-19 (p = .001). In conclusion, COVID-19 pandemic appeared to have an impact on the intention of school teachers to get vaccinated for influenza.

In 2014, the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) reviewed data from one licensed ASO3-adjuvanted influenza A(H5N1) vaccine for consideration of use during inter-pandemic periods among persons with occupational exposure. To guide vaccine policy decisions, we conducted a survey of laboratory workers to assess demand for HPAI vaccination. METHODS: We designed an anonymous web survey (EpiInfo 7.0) to collect information on demographics, type of work and time spent with HPAI viruses, and interest in HPAI vaccination. Eligible participants were identified from 42 entities registered with United States Department of Agriculture’s Agricultural Select Agent program in 2016 and emailed electronic surveys. Personnel with Biosafety Level 3 enhanced (BSL-3E) laboratory access were surveyed. Descriptive analysis was performed. RESULTS: Overall, 131 responses were received from 33 principal investigators, 26 research scientists, 24 technicians, 15 postdoctoral fellows, 6 students, and 27 others. The estimated response rate was 15% among the laboratory personnel of responding principal investigators. One hundred respondents reported working in a BSL-3E area where HPAI experiments occurred with a mean time of 5.1–11.7 h per week. Overall, 49% were interested in receiving an A(H5N1) vaccine. By role, interest was highest among students (80%) and among those who spent >50% of their time in a BSL-3E area (64%).

Social distancing and fever detection have been widely employed to counteract the COVID-19 pandemic, sparking great interest from academia, industry and public administrations worldwide. While most solutions have dealt with the two aspects separately, milliTRACE-IR combines, via a robust sensor fusion approach, mm-wave radars and infrared thermal cameras. The system achieves fully automated measurement of distancing and body temperature, by jointly tracking the faces of the subjects in the thermal camera image plane and the human motion in the radar reference system. It achieves decimeter-level accuracy in distance estimation, inter-personal distance estimation (effective for subjects getting as close as 0.2 m), and accurate temperature monitoring (max. errors of 0.5 C). Moreover, milliTRACE-IR performs contact tracing: a person with high body temperature is reliably detected by the thermal camera sensor and subsequently traced across a large indoor area in a non-invasive way by the radars.

In this time series-based analysis, dynamics of multidisciplinary care for chronic pain and opioid prescribing are analyzed over a forty-four year time span. Three distinct periods are identified, each defined by distinct research areas, as well as priorities regarding the use of opioids and the appropriate management of chronic pain. These scientometrically defined periods align with timelines identified previously by narrative historical accounts. Through cross-correlation with a mortality time series, a significant two-year lag between opioid overdose mortality and citation dynamics is identified between 2004 and 2019. This analysis demonstrates a bidirectional relationship between the scientific literature and the North American opioid overdose crisis, suggesting that the scientific literature is both reflective and generative of an important health and social phenomenon.

Countries across Asia have imposed these containment measures to varying extents. However, residents in different countries would have a differing degree of compliance to these containment measures potentially due to differences in the level of awareness and motivation in the early phase of pandemic.ObjectivesIn our study, we aimed to describe and correlate the level of knowledge and attitude with the level of compliance with personal hygiene and physical distancing practices among Asian countries in the early phase of pandemic.MethodsA multinational cross-sectional study was carried out using electronic surveys between May and June 2020 across 14 geographical areas.

This study was conducted to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of TCZ as an adjunct therapy for the treatment of severe COVID-19 infection. This was a retrospective observational chart review of confirmed COVID-19 patients who received TCZ, along with other COVID-19 therapies. The outcomes of interest included changes in vital signs such as temperature and laboratory biomarkers, duration of mechanical ventilation, adverse events possibly associated with TCZ, and intensive care unit and hospital lengths of stay. This study included 38 patients with an average age of 63 years (IQR, 48-70 years). The average dose of TCZ given was 519 ± 61 mg. Median C-reactive protein significantly decreased following TCZ administration (189.9 vs 54.8 mg/L, P = .003). Nineteen of all febrile patients before the initiation of TCZ (73%) became fever free on the fourth day of TCZ treatment. Following TCZ treatment, 11 patients developed infections because of multidrug-resistant bacteria, and elevated liver transaminases were observed in 6 patients.

Consequently, in this paper, we expand on the concept of a topological particle filter (TPF) to accurately and individually localize and track workers in a farm environment, integrating information from heterogeneous sensors and combining local active sensing (exploiting a robot's onboard sensing employing a Next-Best-Sense planning approach) and global localization (using affordable IoT GNSS devices).

Accepted manuscripts have been peer-reviewed and copyedited, but are posted online before technical formatting and author proofing. These manuscripts are not the final version of record and will be replaced with the final article (formatted per AJHP style and proofed by the authors) at a later time. PURPOSE: Clinical pharmacist productivity assessment has long been challenging, as a standard definition does not exist. A multistep project was undertaken with the intent to develop, validate, and implement an acute care clinical pharmacist productivity model. The initial step of the project was designed to identify, define, prioritize, and weight a comprehensive list of daily pharmacist responsibilities stratified by relative time spent on each function via consensus. METHODS: Delphi methodology applied by a panel of experts was used to identify a comprehensive list of acute care pharmacist responsibilities ranked in order of time intensity. Twenty-three acute care clinical pharmacists participated in the process. The consensus list was validated by time observation studies. Each responsibility was assigned a weight and corresponding work outputs by a consensus panel. Weighting of each responsibility was assigned according to the relative time intensity and complexity of each task. RESULTS: The results of the Delphi consensus process included the top 20 time-intensive responsibilities identified by the acute care clinical pharmacists. Timed observations of acute care clinical pharmacists yielded results similar to those of the consensus process. Selection of corresponding work outputs and weights for each responsibility provided the final requirements for the productivity model. CONCLUSION: The development of an acute care clinical pharmacist productivity model first requires the selection of appropriate work outputs and weighting. The consensus process provided a newly identified comprehensive list of pharmacist responsibilities that will serve as the foundation of the clinical productivity model. Validated consensus methodology can be useful for engaging clinical pharmacists in decision-making and the development of a clinical productivity model.",2021,"Vest, Tyler A; Simmons, Adrienne; Morbitzer, Kathryn A; McLaughlin, Jacqueline E; Cicci, Jonathan; Clarke, Megan; Valgus, John M; Falato, Chris; Waldron, Kayla M",Am. j. health system pharm,,#1217811,,,,,233870411.0

There were similarities and differences in the public health and social measures taken by countries, and comparative analysis facilitates cross-country learning of contextual practices and sharing lessons to mitigate the COVID-19 pandemic impact. Our aim is to conduct a situational analysis of the public health and social measures to mitigate the health and economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic in Turkey, Egypt, Ukraine, Kazakhstan, and Poland during 2020–2021. METHODS: We conducted a situational analysis of the COVID-19 pandemic response in Turkey, Egypt, Ukraine, Kazakhstan, and Poland from the perspectives of the health system and health finance, national coordination, surveillance, testing capacity, health infrastructure, healthcare workforce, medical supply, physical distancing and non-pharmaceutical interventions, health communication, impact on non-COVID-19 health services, impact on the economy, education, gender and civil liberties, and COVID-19 vaccination. RESULTS: Since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, Turkey, Egypt, Ukraine, Kazakhstan, and Poland have expanded COVID-19 testing and treatment capacity over time. However, they faced a shortage of healthcare workforce and medical supplies. They took population-based quarantine measures rather than individual-based isolation measures, which significantly burdened their economies and disrupted education. The unemployment rate increased, and economic growth stagnated. Economic stimulus policy was accompanied by high inflation. Despite the effort to sustain essential health services, healthcare access declined. Schools were closed for 5–11 months. Gender inequality was aggravated in Turkey and Ukraine, and an issue was raised for balancing public health measures and civil liberties in Egypt and Poland. Digital technologies played an important role in maintaining routine healthcare, education, and public health communication. CONCLUSIONS: The COVID-19 pandemic has exposed weaknesses in healthcare systems in the emerging economies of Turkey, Egypt, Ukraine, Kazakhstan, and Poland, and highlighted the intricate link between health and economy. Individual-level testing, isolation, and contact tracing are effective public health interventions in mitigating the health and economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic in comparison to population-level measures of lockdowns.

The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database was searched and the expression patterns of HOXB-AS3 in head and neck carcinoma were analyzed. Reverse transcription-quantitative PCR and western blot analysis was used to measure the mRNA and protein expression level of HOXB-AS3 in patients with OSCC, respectively. Next, HOXB-AS3 was knocked down in 2 OSCC cell lines to investigate the biological function of the HOXB-AS3-encoded protein using a Cell Counting Kit-8 and colony formation assays. To further identify the potential mechanism of the HOXB-AS3-encoded protein, co-immunoprecipitation was also used to detect the interaction between HOXB-AS3 and IGF2BP2, while HOXB-AS3 was re-expressed to determine whether the HOXB-AS3-encoded protein and not HOXB-AS3 exerted its function in OSCC. HOXB-AS3 was upregulated in OSCC tissues, in both TCGA database and in patients with OSCC recruited into the present study. HOXB-AS3 was associated with poor prognosis in OSCC. The proliferation and viability decreased in the 2 OSCC cell lines following knock down of HOXB-AS3. HOXB-AS3 was also found to encode a protein that directly interacted with IGF2BP2 and thereby promoted the stability of c-myc. Taken together, the results from the present study indicated that increased HOXB-AS3 expression was associated with poor prognosis in OSCC.

In this study, we set to identify the activity and mechanism of circ_0002945 in AD pathogenesis. METHODS: The levels of circ_0002945, microRNA (miR)-431-5p and TNF alpha induced protein 1 (TNFAIP1) were measured by quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) or western blot. The levels of cleaved caspase-12, glucose regulated protein 78 (GRP78) and C/EBP homologous protein (CHOP), the markers of cell endoplasmic reticulum stress, were gauged by western blot. Cell viability and apoptosis abilities were evaluated by MTT assay and flow cytometry, respectively. The direct relationship between miR-431-5p and circ_0002945 or TNFAIP1 was verified by the dual-luciferase reporter or RNA immunoprecipitation (RIP) assay. RESULTS: Our data showed that circ_0002945 was overexpressed in AD serum and amyloid beta (Aß)25-35-stimulated SK-N-SH cells and human primary neurons (HPNs). Inhibition of circ_0002945 attenuated Aß25-35-induced cell apoptosis and endoplasmic reticulum stress. MiR-431-5p was regulated by circ_0002945 and it was responsible for the circ_0002945 function. Moreover, TNFAIP1 was a miR-431-5p target and circ_0002945 functioned as a ceRNA to control TNFAIP1 expression via miR-431-5p competition.

The warheads are discussed by targeted residues, mechanism and selectivity, and analyzed through three different datasets including our collection of warheads, the CovPDB database, and the FDA approved covalent drugs. Moreover, the authors summarize general practices that facilitate the selection of the appropriate warhead for the target of interest. EXPERT OPINION In spite of the numerous electrophilic warheads, only a fraction of them is used in current drug discovery projects. Recent studies identified new tractable residues by applying a wider array of warhead chemistries. However, versatile, selective warheads are not available for all targetable amino acids, hence discovery of new warheads for these residues is needed.

Based on microblog users' network connection, this paper analyzes the network factors that affect the uncertain spillover effect between regions by using ERGM. It is found that there are three peaks of uncertainty spillover effect in China, corresponding to the financial crisis in 2008, the post financial crisis in 2010 and COVID-19 in early 2020. As an effective transmission mode and a reflection of inter provincial relations, close social relationships are crucial in the study of uncertainty spillover effects. Relatively developed provinces have higher spillover effect, while relatively underdeveloped provinces are usually the recipients of uncertainty in the network. In particular, the impact of inter provincial social network on uncertainty spillover is statistically more significant than that of GDP, population, transportation and other node attributes.",2021,"Ma, Dan Zhang Chuan Hui Yarong Xu Bing",,,#ppcovidwho-316012,,,,https://doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.3873690,235669262.0

The objective of this study was to compare the clinical presentation of SARS-CoV-2 infections among preschool (<5 years) versus school-aged (≥5 years) children diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2 infection, and, specifically, the probability of presenting with an isolated symptom, such rhinorrhea or sore throat. METHODS: Retrospective study of children (≤18 years of age) diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2 in the outpatient COVID-19 clinic or the Emergency Department at the Centre Hospitalier Universitaire Sainte-Justine (Montreal, Quebec, Canada) February through May 2020. RESULTS: Of 3,789 children tested, 105 (3%) were positive for SARS-CoV-2, and 104 included in the analysis (n=49 age <5 years and n=55 age ≥5 years). While fever was the most common presenting symptom across both age groups, in the absence of fever, the presence of a combination of two or more symptoms identified the majority (92%) of cases. Isolated single symptom presentations were uncommon (<5% of cases). Most importantly, not a single child in either age group presented with isolated rhinorrhea or sore throat. CONCLUSIONS: While there are differences in the clinical manifestations of COVID-19 in preschool- versus school-aged children, in both age groups, isolated rhinorrhea was not a manifestation of SARS-CoV-2 infection.

The lack of stringent proofreading mechanisms makes viral DNA/RNA replication error-prone. When a virus replicates, it sometimes changes a little bit, which is called mutations. Any virus with one or more new mutations can be referred to as a “variant” of the original virus. The last 2 years have witnessed the emergence of a large number of variants. Since the pandemic’s beginning, the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus has mutated extensively, resulting in the emergence of different variants of the virus. One of these is the delta variant (arising from Pango lineage B.1.617.2) that took the word in a storm this year (February-July). The current a variant of concern is the B.1.1.529 (Omicron) variant reported first from South Africa on November 24, 2021. In recent weeks, infections have been widely reported, along with the increased detection of the B.1.1.529 variant. We reviewed the emergence of the new variant (B1.1.529) and its possible outcomes.

MethodsWe used Hospital Episode Statistics to identify all people alive 01 March 2020 with ICD-10 codes for RAIRD from the whole population of England. We used linked national health records (demographic, death certificate, admissions and PCR testing data) to calculate rates of COVID-19 infection and death up to 31 July 2020. Our primary definition of COVID-19-related death was mention of COVID-19 on the death certificate. General population data from Public Health England and the Office for National Statistics were used for comparison. We also describe COVID-19-related hospital admissions and all-cause deaths. ResultsWe identified a cohort of 168,680 people with RAIRD, of whom 1874 (1.11%) had a positive COVID-19 PCR test. The age-standardised infection rate was 1.54 (95% CI 1.50-1.59) times higher than in the general population. 713 (0.42%) people with RAIRD died with COVID-19 on their death certificate and the age-sex-standardised mortality rate for COVID-19-related death was 2.41 (2.30 - 2.53) times higher than in the general population. There was no evidence of an increase in deaths from other causes in the RAIRD population.

A published novel assessment process combining the well-validated Cochrane Review measures, the AMSTAR 2 checklist, and a published algorithm specifically designed for conducting a scoping review of similar meta-analyses was employed. This scoping review identified and evaluated 28 meta-analysis reports, published between 2000 and 2021, on the associations of soy intakes with cardiovascular, cancer, and diabetes II diseases. It identified 18 significantly negatively associated risk-disease pairs for total soy intakes, four significantly negatively associated risk-disease pairs for unfermented soy intakes, and four significantly negatively associated risk-disease pairs for fermented soy intakes when compared high against low intakes. The largest significant risk decrease found was gastric cancer mortalities with relative risk (RR) 0.49 (95% CI: 0.35, 0.68); followed by colorectal cancer mortalities RR 0.59 (95% CI: 0.41, 0.84); ovarian cancer RR 0.52 (95% CI: 0.42, 0.66); and endocrine-related gynaecological cancer RR 0.61 (95% CI: 0.53, 0.72).

The aims of the present study were to describe the perioperative outcomes of COVID−19 patients that underwent emergency general surgery and to determine possible predictors of mortality and postoperative complications. Methods A prospective study of positive COVID−19 patients that needed an emergency general surgery procedure at our center was performed. Results From March 2020 to February 2021, 44 patients were included. We found that patients with SARS-CoV−2 symptomatic disease have increased postoperative complications, higher ICU admissions, prolonged length of stay, and decreased 90-day survival as compared with asymptomatic COVID−19 patients. The 90-day survival probability of the entire cohort was 70.1% (60.3–79.9) and was significantly lower in patients with COVID−19 symptoms 63.4% (50.5–76.2). We found the following cut-off values for the prediction of mortality: ferritin ≥ 438.5 ng/mL (AUC = 0.908), CRP value ≥ 12.5 mg/dL (AUC = 0.715), leukocyte ≥ 13.8 x103/µL (AUC = 0.706), and albumin ≤ 2.78 g/dL (AUC = 704,).

In many institutions, including ours, patient care was redistributed from a specialty-based approach to a ward-based system, meaning some patients being admitted and managed under the care of non-specialist teams. Purpose: We wished to examine the impact of these changes on heart failure (HF) patients presenting during the pandemic and on appropriate delivery of complex device therapies. Methods: The study was undertaken in a large UK teaching hospital. The institution audit programme includes cardiac device therapy provision, aiming to ensure that implantable cardioverter defibrillators and cardiac resynchronisation therapy are offered to the target population in accordance with NICE guidance [Technology Appraisal 314]. In accordance with the guidance, patients admitted to hospital with serious ventricular arrhythmia, familial cardiac condition with high risk of sudden cardiac death (SCD), surgical repair of congenital heart disease (CHD) and patients with HF and LVEF<36% were identified from hospital coding. Findings during the pandemic (March to August 2020) were compared with the same period in 2019. Fisher's exact test was used to compare proportions. Results: Among non-HF patients, device therapy prescription was consistent in the two periods observed. Table 1 shows how many patients were eligible for device therapy and how many were offered it. Table 2 contains details of HF admissions, showing an 8% reduction in admissions during the pandemic. The proportion of patients eligible for device therapy did not change significantly. However, there was a significant reduction in the proportion of eligible patients who were offered device therapy (79% vs 94% p=0.03). In addition, during the pandemic there was a trend towards a greater chance of patients being considered too frail for device therapy (p=0.08). Among 12 patients overlooked for device therapy, 10 were not under the care of Cardiology. Among 31 patients considered too frail for device therapy, 26 were not under the care of Cardiology. Conclusion: During the Covid-19 pandemic, a modest reduction in HF hospital admission was observed with a marked fall in identification of patients eligible for device therapy. Possible explanations include intense pressure to discharge patients quickly, an increased perception of patient frailty during a crisis and the lack of recognition of indications for device therapy when patients are under the care of non-specialists. These findings suggest that cardiac services should actively look for HF patients who may have missed out on life-saving device therapies during the pandemic.",2021,"Hall, R.; Chattopadhyay, R.; Pugh, P.

Objective: To characterize how often individuals in six communities throughout the United States used a digital assistant to log rapid-antigen test results and report them to their local Department of Health. Design: This prospective cohort study is based on anonymously collected data from the beneficiaries of The Say Yes! Covid Test program, which distributed 3,000,000 rapid antigen tests at no cost to residents of six communities between April and October 2021. We provide a descriptive evaluation of beneficiaries' use of digital assistant for logging and reporting their rapid antigen test results. Main Outcome and Measures: Number and proportion of tests logged and reported to the Department of Health through the digital assistant Results: A total of 178,785 test kits were ordered by the digital assistant, and 14,398 households used the digital assistant to log 41,465 test results. Overall, a small proportion of beneficiaries used the digital assistant (8%), but over 75% of those who used it reported their rapid antigen test results to their state public health department.

The shedding of PRCV/TGEV was studied at different days post-arrival in fecal and nasal swabs from PRCV/TGEV seronegative sentinel pigs introduced into a PRCV seropositive herd with questionable TGEV serology and diarrhea. Nasal shedding of PRCV was detected in 57% and 63% of samples by nested-RT-PCR and cell culture immunofluorescence (CCIF), respectively. However fecal shedding of PRCV was detected in 37% of the samples by nested-RT-PCR and 19% by CCIF. Four respiratory and 5 fecal PRCV strains were isolated in swine testicle cells including nasal/fecal PRCV pairs (isolated at the same time) from 3 pigs. Comparison of nasal/fecal PRCV pairs from individual pigs revealed different deletions in the spike (S) gene (648 or 681 nt) in 2 pairs and a consistent change in nt 790/791 (aa T to V) for all pairs. In preliminary studies, inoculation of gnotobiotic pigs with each plaque-purified pair of the nasal and fecal PRCV isolates, revealed no clinical disease but different tropisms. The nasal isolate was shed both nasally and in feces, but the fecal isolate was shed only marginally in feces, and not nasally. Our results show that nested-RT-PCR was as sensitive as CCIF for PRCV detection in nasal swabs, but was more sensitive than CCIF for PRCV detection in fecal samples; alternatively PRCV shed in feces was more labile with loss of infectivity. The S-gene sequence differences found between the fecal and respiratory PRCV isolates may influence their tissue tropism. These new PRCV isolates should be useful to understand the molecular basis of coronavirus tropism and evolution in infected swine.",2003-11-26,"Costantini, V.; Lewis, P.; Alsop, J.; Templeton, C.; Saif, L.

Minimal invasive surgery has multiple advantages in neurologically impaired patients. Robotic approach has overcome disadvantages linked to laparoscopy, in particular, referring to the surgeon fatigue. METHODS A retrospective study comparing five laparoscopic and five robotic TOGD was conducted between February and October 2016 in Giannina Gaslini Children's Hospital and Section of Pediatric Surgery of Siena. Neurologically impaired children scheduled for TOGD were included. Age, sex, weight, symptomatology, presence of epilepsy, and preoperative X-ray contrast were considered. Operative time, hospital stay, postoperative complications, redo surgery, nutrition rehabilitation, and X-ray contrast study after 5 days and after 1 month from the intervention were recorded. RESULTS In our series, there were no intraoperative complications, no conversions to open surgery, and no vagal lesions. In two of five robotic cases, a pyloroplasty was necessary. The median operative time was statistically longer in the robotic group. One dehiscence in the robotic group was recorded, and no dumping episodes occurred. No statistical differences in terms of complications were detected. CONCLUSION TOGD is feasible both with laparoscopic and robotic-assisted surgery with similar results. Robotic approach is considered feasible.

Even though the idea is not to intervene, the studies conducted during follow-up may affect the target population. Our hypotheses were that the participation to prospective Northern Finland Birth Cohort 1986 study (NFBC 1986) increases the use of mental health services and reduces the suicidal behaviour due to participation in follow-up study. Methods: The study cohort NFBC 1986 covers the people born with expected date of birth between July 1985 and June 1986 in northern Finland (N=9,396). The participants of the NFBC 1986 have been followed since antenatal time with follow-ups including clinical examinations. The comparison cohort comprises of people born in the same area in 1987 (N=8,959), who have not been contacted. Register data of psychiatric treatment, suicide attempts and suicides were available. Crude risk ratios (RR) and adjusted (with marital status and education) Mantel-Haenszel Risk Ratios (RRMH) were reported. Results: No significant differences between NFBC 1986 and comparison cohorts in any mental disorders were detected. In crude risk ratio analysis of female, the decreased risk for the suicide attempts was found (RR: 0.67 (95% CI: 0.49-0.92), p=0.011). Conclusion: Results did not support our first hypothesis of increased use of mental health services in the NFBC 1986. On the other hand, our second hypothesis gained some support as female participants of the NFBC 1986 had decreased risk for suicide attempts, although it was not due to higher number of participants receiving psychiatric treatment.",2022,"Kerkelä, Martta; Gissler, Mika; Veijola, Juha",Epidemiol Health,,#mdl-34990532,,,,https://doi.org/10.4178/epih.e2022005; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34990532/,245681261.0

Research assistants obtained anterior nasal and oropharyngeal swabs from HCP in the workplace following development of respiratory illness symptoms and randomly while asymptomatic. Participants received take-home kits to self-collect swabs when absent from work. Samples mailed to a central laboratory were tested for respiratory viruses by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. RESULTS: Among 2,862 participants, 3,467 swabs were obtained from symptomatic participants. Among symptomatic HCP, respiratory virus was detected in 904 of 3,467 (26.1%) samples. Self-collected samples by symptomatic HCP at home had higher rates of viral detection (40.3%) compared to 24% obtained by trained research assistants in the workplace (P < .001). CONCLUSIONS: In this randomized clinical trial, take-home kits were an easily implemented, effective method to self-collect samples by HCP.

METHODS: This study is a cross-sectional study conducted at the Prince Mohammed International Airport in Al-Madinah Al-Munawwarah, Saudi Arabia between August and September 2014. Data were collected by semi-structured questionnaires during personal interviews. Non-random purposive sampling was conducted to target workers at higher risk of acquiring infection from travellers. RESULTS: One hundred and eighty-six participants were recruited of whom 92.5% were males. The study participants were workers in 8 different sectors. Twenty-six percent of the participants were health workers. Non-health workers were more likely to be concerned on acquiring infection while working at the airport compared with health workers (p=0.023). The most commonly feared disease was Ebola viral disease (EBV) among 30% of health workers, and 47% of non-health workers. Approximately 47% of non-health workers reported no knowledge of the procedures implemented during public health emergencies. The proportion of participants who received public health related training among non-health workers was significantly lower compared with health workers (p<0.00001).

METHODS: The city of Yazd, in central Iran was selected for this study, with the highest population of Zoroastrians in Iran. Subjects were selected by cluster sampling of 9 neighborhoods populated with Zoroastrians. Subjects ≥15 years old were interviewed by trained interviewers in their houses. The validated Farsi translation of Community Oriented Program for the Control of Rheumatic Disease (COPCORD) Core Questionnaire (CCQ) was used for this study. Subjects with musculoskeletal complaints (pain, stiffness and/or swelling) were examined by a rheumatologist. Laboratory tests and radiographic exams were performed when deemed necessary. RESULTS: Two-thousand subjects were interviewed during a 12-month period, of which 956 were male, and 1044 were female. The mean age was 41.1 ± 18.3 years (95%CI: 40.3-41.9). 36.9% of the subjects had university-level education.

Fourteen studies were included in meta-analysis. The effects of ketogenic diets on glycemic control were greater for diabetic patients relative to those of low-fat diets, indicated by lower glycated hemoglobin (SMD, -0.62; p < 0.001) and homeostatic model assessment index (SMD, -0.29; p = 0.02), while comparable effects were observed for nondiabetic patients. Ketogenic diets led to substantial weight reduction (SMD, -0.46; p = 0.04) irrespective of patients' diabetes status at baseline and improved lipid profiles in terms of lower triglyceride (SMD, -0.45; p = 0.01) and greater high-density lipoprotein (SMD, 0.31; p = 0.005) for diabetic patients.

They are also detected outside of exacerbation. Alteration of anti-viral response in asthmatic patients has been shown although the mechanisms responsible for this defect remain unclear. The objective of this study was to compare in virus-infected and not-infected allergic asthmatic children, aged 6 to 16 years, admitted to hospital for a severe exacerbation, the innate immune response and especially the expression of pattern recognition receptor (PRR) and their function. METHODS: Virus identification was performed both during the exacerbation and at steady state (eight weeks later). Data assessed at both periods included clinical features, anti-viral response and inflammation (in sputum and plasma), and PRR expression/function in blood mononuclear cells. RESULTS: Viruses were identified in 46 out of 72 children (median age 8.9 years) during exacerbation, and among them, in 17 at steady state. IFN-β, IFN-γ and IL-29 levels in sputum and plasma were similar between infected and not infected patients at both times, as well as the expression of TLR3, RIG-I and MDA5 in blood monocytes and dendritic cells. Airway inflammation in infected patients was characterized by significantly higher IL-5 concentration and eosinophil count. Compared to patients only infected at exacerbation, the re-infected children significantly exhibited lower levels of IFN-γ in plasma and sputum at exacerbation associated with modifications in PRR expression and function in blood mononuclear cells. These re-infected patients also presented an airway neutrophilic inflammation at steady state. CONCLUSION: Our results reports in asthmatic children that impaired anti-viral response during virus-induced exacerbation is more pronounced in a subgroup of patients prone to re-infection by virus. This subgroup is characterized by altered PRR function and a different pattern of airway inflammation.

The competition will create wealth, leading to improved living standards for individuals and the economy at large. Moreover, innovation and creation result in new and superior products that enable modern markets to be developed. However, the enthusiasm to become an entrepreneur is not the sole driving factor. One must know the importance of financial literacy. Besides, the negative stigma due to the COVID-19 pandemic ruined many lives and impacted businesses with less money due to the reduction of clientele;also, it had impacted budding entrepreneurs (at early start-up stages, and hardly have had experience between 1-3 years) with fewer opportunities to make money. That reduced the willingness of entrepreneurs to invest capital in the business due to raging losses. The current article presents the importance of financial literacy for budding entrepreneurs. To find and measure the financial literacy among budding entrepreneurs, the data were distributed to 223 entrepreneurs;however, 179 were finally used for analysis due to several reasons mentioned in the research methodology. The data was collected from five districts of the South region of India (Kerala, Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka, Telangana, and Tamil Nadu) and the snowball technique is used in the analysis. The study revealed that most budding entrepreneurs lack proper financial literacy. The study found that Financial Skills, Financial Knowledge, Financial Attitude, Social Interactions & Past Experiences, Financial Support & Guidance directly influenced Financial Literacy levels among entrepreneurs. The study also suggests that aspiring entrepreneurs should be given practical financial training sessions;it should be made mandatory. © Universal Journal of Accounting and Finance 2021.",2021,"Polisetty, A.; Lalitha, N.; Singu, H.

Affective response following sedentary time may influence motivation to remain sedentary. Ecological Momentary Assessment (EMA) is a real-time data capture methodology that can be used to identify factors influencing sedentary time, such as the context of the home setting, and resulting affective state within a free-living setting. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the relationship between context at home and adolescent sedentary time, and the relationship of sedentary time and subsequent affect. METHODS: Adolescents (n = 284; 10-16 y) participated in an EMA study that used random, interval-based sampling methods. Adolescents each received 22 unannounced surveys over 7-days through a smartphone application. One survey was randomly sent within each 2-h time-period. These time-periods occurred between 4:00 pm-8:00 pm on weekdays and 8:00 am-8:00 pm on the weekend. This 15-question survey included a series of questions on context (indoors/outdoors, alone/not alone) and positive affect. Adolescents concurrently wore an accelerometer at the hip, and the 30-min bout of accelerometry data prior to each survey was used in analyses. Mixed-effect location scale models were used to examine the association between context at home and sedentary time (stage 1) and the adjusted sedentary time and positive affect (stage 2), with each model adjusted for covariates. RESULTS: Adolescents were 12.6 ± 1.9 y of age on average, about half were White (58%), and engaged in high levels of sedentary behavior during the 30 min prior to the survey (21.4 ± 6.8 min). Most surveys occurred when adolescents were with others (59%) and indoors (88%). In Stage 1, both being alone and being indoors at home were positively associated with sedentary time (p < 0.001 for both). In Stage 2, adjusted sedentary time was not related to positive affect. Age was negatively related to positive affect (p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Both contextual factors, being alone and indoors at home, were related to additional time spent sedentary compared to being with someone or outdoors. After adjustment, sedentary time was not related to subsequent positive affect, indicating other factors may be related to adolescent's positive affect in home settings.",2021,"Kracht, Chelsea L; Beyl, Robbie A; Maher, Jaclyn P; Katzmarzyk, Peter T; Staiano, Amanda E",Int J Behav Nutr Phys Act,,#1191950,,,,,233239234.0

DESIGN: A prospective electronic questionnaire-based survey. SETTING: The survey was initiated by the Education Committee of the European Association of Cardiothoracic Anesthesiology and Intensive Care (EACTAIC) PARTICIPANTS: EACTAIC fellows, EACTAIC and non-EACTAIC subscribers to the EACTAIC newsletter and EACTAIC followers on different social media platforms. INTERVENTIONS: After obtaining the consent of participants, we assessed the peri-operative management of COVID-19 patients, infrastructural aspects of the workplace, local routines for preoperative testing, the perceived availability of personal protective equipment (PPE) and the impact of COVID-19 on fellowship training. In addition participants rated suggested solutions by the investigators to cope with the interruption of fellowship training using a traffic light signal scale. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: We collected 193 responses from 54 countries. 82.4% of respondents reported cancelling or postponing elective cases during the first wave. Of the respondents, 89.7% had provided care for COVID-19 patients, 75.1% reported staff in their center being reassigned to work in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU), and 45% perceived a shortage of PPE at their centers. Most respondents reported the termination of local educational activities (79.6%) and fellowship assessments (51.5%) because of the pandemic (although 84% of them reported having time to participate in online teaching), and 83% reported a definitive psychological impact. More than 90% of the respondents chose green and/or yellow traffic lights to rate the importance of the suggested solutions to cope with the interrupted fellowship training during the pandemic. CONCLUSIONS: The COVID-19 pandemic led to the cancellation of elective cases, deployment of anesthesiologists to intensive care units, involvement of anesthesiologists in perioperative care for COVID-19 patients, and interruption of educational activities and trainees’ assessments.

Little is known about this storage because geochemical and geophysical observations are limited to pits, boreholes, or outcrops or to inferences based on indirect measurements between these sites. We trained a rock physics model to borehole observations in a well-constrained ridge and valley landscape and then interpreted spatial variations in seismic refraction velocities. We discovered that P-wave velocities track where a porosity-generating reaction initiates in shale in three boreholes across the landscape. Specifically, velocities of 2.7 ± 0.2 km/s correspond with growth of porosity from dissolution of chlorite, the most reactive of the abundant minerals in the shale. In addition, sonic velocities are consistent with the presence of gas bubbles beneath the water table under valley and ridge. We attribute this gas largely to CO2 produced by 1) microbial respiration in soils as meteoric waters recharge into the subsurface and 2) the coupled carbonate dissolution and pyrite oxidation at depth in the rock. Bubbles may nucleate below the water table because waters depressurize as they flow from ridge to valley and because pores have dilated as the deep rock has been exhumed by erosion. Many of these observations are likely to also describe the weathering and flow path patterns in other headwater landscapes. Such combined geophysical and geochemical observations will help constrain models predicting flow, storage, and reaction of groundwater in bedrock systems.",2020-07-27,"Gu, Xin; Mavko, Gary; Ma, Lisa; Oakley, David; Accardo, Natalie; Carr, Bradley J; Nyblade, Andrew A; Brantley, Susan L",Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,,,,,,https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2003451117; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32719121/,220841391.0

This study compared mortality associated with diagnoses of respiratory viruses during the colder months of 2018-2019 and 2019-2020 (week 47-week 14). In 2018-2019, 73 patients (0.17% of 42,851 hospitalized patients) died after being diagnosed with a respiratory virus; 40 and 13 deaths occurred in patients diagnosed with influenza A virus and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), respectively.

Parkinson's disease (PD) patients lost their normal routine and interrupted regular physical activity, either as physiotherapy or sport, with inevitable consequence on their daily‐life and well‐being. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the changes in physical activity due to COVID‐19 emergency, including self‐management strategies or technology‐assisted activities, and the subsequent clinical implications in PD patients. METHODS: 74 PD patients from an Italian centre have been remotely examined during the lockdown (April‐May 2020) by an e‐mail structured survey, including self‐administered scales. We collected and analysed data on changes, modalities and amount of physical active practice, on the use of technology‐based tools, and on self‐perceived clinical condition. RESULTS: 60% of patients reported a significant worsening of their general conditions during the lockdown, the reduction of physical activity being the main risk factor for such change. However, patients found ways to practice physical activity, using satisfactorily technology assistance in 50% of cases (mostly women). CONCLUSIONS: COVID‐19 emergency has been an ordeal for PD patients. Nevertheless, patients adapted their habits to continue practicing physical activity that resulted a main determinant of their well‐being, and even successfully approached technology‐based assistance.

However, chronic lesions with subsequent functional impairment result from eventual failure of the remyelination process, as seen in multiple sclerosis. Studies using animal models of successful remyelination delineate a progression of events facilitating remyelination. A universal feature of this repair process is extensive proliferation of oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (OPs) in response to demyelination. To investigate signals that regulate OP proliferation in response to demyelination we used murine hepatitis virus‐A59 (MHV‐A59) infection of adult mice to induce focal demyelination throughout the spinal cord followed by spontaneous remyelination. We cultured glial cells directly from demyelinating and remyelinating spinal cords using conditions that maintain the dramatically enhanced OP proliferative response prior to CNS remyelination. We identify PDGF and FGF2 as significant mitogens regulating this proliferative response. Furthermore, we demonstrate endogenous PDGF and FGF2 activity in these glial cultures isolated from demyelinated CNS tissue. These findings correlate well with our previous demonstration of increased in vivo expression of PDGF and FGF2 ligand and corresponding receptors in MHV‐A59 lesions. Together these studies support the potential of these pathways to function in vivo as critical factors in regulating remyelination. © 2003 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Although immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs), especially those exploiting the PD1-PD-L1 axis, have recently been granted landmark regulatory approvals in TNBC, they provide benefit only to a subset of TNBC patients. To impact mechanisms of primary and secondary resistance to the anti-tumor immune response, novel targets such as ICOS, LAG3 and TIM3 are currently being explored at preclinical and early-phase clinical levels. AREAS COVERED This article examines the landscape of the immune therapeutics investigated in early-phase clinical trials for TNBC. Preclinical rationale is provided for each immune target, predominant expression, and function. Clinical implications and preliminary available trial results are discussed and finally, we reflect on aspects of future expectations and challenges in this field. EXPERT OPINION Several immune strategies have been investigated in TNBC, including co-inhibitory molecules beyond PD1-PD-L1 axis, co-stimulatory checkpoints, cancer vaccines, adoptive cell transfer, combination therapies, as well as different routes of administration. Most of approaches showed signs of anti-cancer activity and a good safety profile in early-phase clinical trials. Since IO provided benefit only to a small subgroup of TNBC patients so far, identifying predictive biomarkers is a priority to refine patient-selection. Data from ongoing clinical trials, with the gradually improving interpretation of the breast tumor immune environment will hopefully refine the role of new immune targets for the treatment of TNBC.",2021-11-11,"Corti, Chiara; Nicolò, Eleonora; Curigliano, Giuseppe",Expert opinion on therapeutic targets,,,,,,https://doi.org/10.1080/14728222.2021.2006187; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34763593/,244040031.0
ojnwx4uz,,Medline; PMC; WHO,Modification in the Motor Skills of Seniors in Care Homes Using Serious Games and the Impact of COVID-19: Field Study,10.2196/36768,PMC9094716,35536610,cc-by,"BACKGROUND: The pandemic has highlighted the importance of low-threshold opportunities for exercise and physical activity. At the beginning of 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic led to many restrictions, which affected seniors in care facilities in the form of severe isolation. The isolation led, among other things, to a lack of exercise, which has led to a multitude of negative effects for this target group. Serious games can potentially help by being used anywhere at any time to strengthen skills with few resources. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of a serious game to strengthen motor skills (study 1) and the influence of pandemic restrictions (study 2) on seniors in care facilities. METHODS: The data on motor skills (measured by the Tinetti test) originated from an intervention study with repeated measurements that was interrupted by the pandemic conditions. Data were collected 4 times every 3 months with an intervention group (IG, training 3 times for 1 hour per week) and a control group (CG, no intervention). There were 2 substudies. The first considered the first 6 months until the pandemic restrictions, while the second considered the influence of the restrictions on motor skills. RESULTS: The sample size was 70. The IG comprised 31 (44%) participants, with 22 (71%) female and 9 (29%) male seniors with an average age of 85 years. The CG comprised 39 (56%) participants, with 31 (79%) female and 8 (21%) male seniors with an average age of 87 years. In study 1, mixed-design ANOVA showed no significant interaction between measurement times and group membership for the first measurements (F(2.136)=1.414, P<.25, partial η2=.044), but there was a significant difference between the CG (mean 16.23, SD 1.1) and the IG (mean 19.81, SD 1.2) at the third time of measurement (P=.02). In study 2 the mixed-design ANOVA (used to investigate motor skills before and after the pandemic conditions between the 2 groups) couldn’t reveal any significant interaction between measurement times and group membership: F(1.67)=2.997, P<.09, partial η2=.043. However, there was a significant main effect of the time of measurement: F(1.67)=5.44, P<.02, partial η²=.075. CONCLUSIONS: During the first 6 months, the IG showed increased motor skills, whereas the motor skills of the CG slightly deteriorated and showed a statistically significant difference after 6 months. The pandemic restrictions leveled the difference and showed a significant negative effect on motor skills over 3 months. As our results show, digital games have the potential to break down access barriers and promote necessary maintenance for important skills. The pandemic has highlighted the importance of low-threshold opportunities for exercise and physical activity. This potentially great benefit for the challenges of tomorrow shows the relevance of the topic and demonstrates the urgent need for action and research.

The governments of the world need to record the confirmed infectious, recovered, and death cases for the present state and predict the cases. In favor of future case prediction, governments can impose opening and closing procedures to save human lives by slowing down the pandemic progression spread. There are several forecasting models for pandemic time series based on statistical processing and machine learning algorithms. Deep learning has been proven as an excellent tool for time series forecasting problems. This paper proposes a deep learning time-series prediction model to forecast the confirmed, recovered, and death cases. Our proposed network is based on an encoding–decoding deep learning network. Moreover, we optimize the selection of our proposed network hyper-parameters. Our proposed forecasting model was applied in Saudi Arabia. Then, we applied the proposed model to other countries. Our study covers two categories of countries that have witnessed different spread waves this year. During our experiments, we compared our proposed model and the other time-series forecasting models, which totaled fifteen prediction models: three statistical models, three deep learning models, seven machine learning models, and one prophet model. Our proposed forecasting model accuracy was assessed using several statistical evaluation criteria. It achieved the lowest error values and achieved the highest R-squared value of 0.99. Our proposed model may help policymakers to improve the pandemic spread control, and our method can be generalized for other time series forecasting tasks.",2021,"Shahin, Ahmed I.; Almotairi, Sultan",Fractal and Fractional,,#covidwho-1480687,,,,https://doi.org/10.3390/fractalfract5040175,239587777.0

We assessed their pharmacodynamic profile and examined the role of the endothelium in mediating their vasomotor effects in vivo in man. METHODS AND RESULTS Eighteen healthy male volunteers (23±4 years) were recruited into a series of double-blind, randomized crossover studies using bilateral forearm venous occlusion plethysmography during intra-arterial urocortin 2 (3.6 to 120 pmol/min), urocortin 3 (1.2 to 36 nmol/min), and substance P (2 to 8 pmol/min) in the presence or absence of inhibitors of cyclooxygenase (aspirin), cytochrome P450 metabolites of arachidonic acid (fluconazole), and nitric oxide synthase (L-NMMA). Urocortins 2 and 3 evoked arterial vasodilatation (P<0.0001) without tachyphylaxis but with a slow onset and offset of action. Inhibition of nitric oxide synthase with L-NMMA reduced vasodilatation to substance P and urocortin 2 (P≤0.001 for both) but had little effect on urocortin 3 (P>0.05). Neither aspirin nor fluconazole affected vasodilatation induced by any of the infusions (P>0.05 for all). In the presence of all 3 inhibitors, urocortin 2- and urocortin 3-induced vasodilatation was attenuated (P<0.001 for all) to a greater extent than with L-NMMA alone (P≤0.005). CONCLUSIONS Urocortins 2 and 3 cause potent and prolonged arterial vasodilatation without tachyphylaxis. These vasomotor responses are at least partly mediated by endothelial nitric oxide and cytochrome P450 metabolites of arachidonic acid. The role of urocortins 2 and 3 remains to be explored in the setting of human heart failure, but they have the potential to have major therapeutic benefits.

METHODS: This retrospective cohort study examined data from every patient who tested positive for COVID-19 and was admitted to White Plains Hospital between March 9, 2020, and June 3, 2020. We used binomial logistic regression to analyze data for all patients, and propensity score matching for those treated with hydroxychloroquine and convalescent plasma (CP). The primary outcome of interest was inpatient mortality. RESULTS: 1,108 admitted patients with COVID-19 were available for analysis, of which 124 (11.2%) were excluded due to incomplete data. Of the 984 patients included, 225 (22.9%) died. Risk for death decreased for each day later a patient was admitted [OR 0.970, CI 0.955 to 0.985; p < 0.001]. Elevated initial C-reactive protein (CRP) value was associated with a higher risk for death at 96 hours [OR 1.007, 1.002 to 1.012; p = 0.006]. Hydroxychloroquine and CP administration were each associated with increased mortality [OR 3.4, CI 1.614 to 7.396; p = 0.002, OR 2.8560, CI 1.361 to 6.160; p = 0.006 respectively]. CONCLUSIONS: Elevated CRP carried significant odds of early death. Hydroxychloroquine and CP were each associated with higher risk for death, although CP was without titers and was administered at a median of five days from admission. Randomized or controlled studies will better describe the impact of CP.

In contrast, chronic moderate drinking (CMD) has been associated with improved cardiovascular health and immunity. These differential outcomes have been linked to alterations in both innate and adaptive branches of the immune system; however, the mechanisms remain poorly understood. To address this question, we determined the impact of chronic drinking on the transcriptional and functional responses of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) collected from male rhesus macaques classified as CMD or CHD after 12 months of voluntary ethanol self-administration. Our analysis suggests that chronic alcohol drinking, regardless of dose alters resting transcriptomes of PBMC, with the largest impact seen in innate immune cells. These transcriptional changes are partially explained by alterations in microRNA profiles. Additionally, chronic alcohol drinking is associated with a dose dependent heightened inflammatory profiled at resting and following LPS stimulation. Moreover, we observed a dose-dependent shift in the kinetics of transcriptional responses to LPS. These findings may explain the dichotomy in clinical and immunological outcomes observed with moderate versus heavy alcohol drinking.",2019-05-24,"Sureshchandra, Suhas; Raus, Anthony; Jankeel, Allen; Ligh, Brian Jin Kee; Walter, Nicole A.

However, their approval is solely based on limited data available from the clinical trials in a short period of time; thereby imposing a necessity to study the adverse events (AEs) associated with their use. This study therefore aims to assess the Serious Adverse Events (SAEs) associated with various COVID 19 vaccines reported in the WHO database (VigiBase). Methods: The data from VigiBase was analyzed to assess the reported SAEs linked to various COVID 19 vaccines. The duplicates in the data were removed and were analyzed on the basis of age, gender, and seriousness of adverse events at the System Organ Classification (SOC) level and the individual Preferred Term (PT) level. Results: A total 103954 adverse events reported from 32044 subjects were taken for analysis. Of 32044 subjects, majority were females (80%). Also, a total of 28799 (27.7%) SAEs were reported from the 8007 individuals. Most of the SAEs were reported from Europe (83%), amongst females (79.4%) and between 18 to 64 years (80.74%) of age. Majority of SAEs (74%) were reported for BNT162b2 (Pfizer) vaccine. On system wise classification, general disorders (30%) were the commonest followed by nervous system (19.1%) and musculoskeletal (11.2%) disorders. In individual category, headache (8.1%) was the commonest, followed by pyrexia (7%) and fatigue (5.1%). The number of SAEs were reported with various vaccines were comparatively lesser as compared to the non-serious ones and incidence of death was low with all the vaccines candidates. Elderly (> 65 years) people reported more serious SAEs as compared to other age groups.

En août 2020, le retour d’expérience de la 1ere vague nous a conduit à l’acquisition d’appareils d’oxygénothérapie haut débit (OHD) pour certains services non habitués à leur usage comme celui des maladies infectieuses (MI). Dans ce contexte, la pratique de l’OHD en service d’hospitalisation conventionnelle (HC) s’est imposée comme alternative dans la prise en charge des patients ayant une pneumopathie grave à SARS-CoV-2 en attente de lit ou récusés de réanimation. Matériels et méthodes Nous présentons une analyse descriptive rétrospective de 32 patients qui ont bénéficié d’une OHD dans le cadre d’une aggravation de leur pneumopathie hypoxémiante à SARS-CoV-2 dans le service de MI d’un centre hospitalier général entre le 20/08/2020 et 15/02/2021. L’objectif de cette étude était d’étudier la mortalité en HC des patients ayant bénéficié d’OHD. Résultats Des 32 patients mis sous OHD en HC, 18 (56 %) étaient éligibles à la réanimation. Treize sur 18 (72,2%) ont pu être transférés en réanimation dans un délai de 24h après la mise en place de l’OHD (3jours pour une patiente). Cinq (27,8 %) patients sont restés en HC avec une durée moyenne d’OHD de 3jours et une durée moyenne d’hospitalisation de 12jours. Il n’y a pas eu de décès chez ces patients. Quatorze patients (44 %) n’avaient pas d’indication à un transfert en réanimation pour critère d’âge (&gt;80 ans). Le sex-ratio était de 1/1, leur moyenne d’âge de 86 ans (80–94 ans). La durée d’hospitalisation moyenne était de 15jours (3–39jours) et la durée moyenne d’OHD de 5jours (1–15jours). Le taux de mortalité en HC des personnes récusées de réanimation sous OHD était de 71 %. Conclusion La pratique de l’OHD en HC a permis d’éviter 5 transferts en réanimation sur 18 patients graves éligibles aux soins continus avec une évolution favorable pour tous. Quant aux personnes de plus de 80 ans, non éligibles à la réanimation, la mortalité restait très élevée (71 %).

Telemedicine was introduced in Singapore in community-based haemodialysis (HD) centres to comply with the Ministry of Health's directives on movement restriction of healthcare workers and related measures to minimise the spread of SARS-CoV-2 in healthcare facilities. METHODS We describe here our experience of 26 community haemodialysis centres in Singapore, analysing clinical audit data, as well as comparing hospitalisation and mortality rates as outcomes in the time frames of pre- and post-introduction of telemedicine. RESULTS We found that the hospitalisation rate was 13.9% (95% CI: 5.6%-21.5%, P<0.001) lower in the period after telemedicine rounds were introduced. The mortality rates per 100 person-years (95% CI) were 11.04 versus 7.99 in the compared groups, respectively, with no significant increase in mortality during the months when telemedicine was performed. CONCLUSION Patients received appropriate care in a timely manner, with telemedicine implementation, and such measures did not lead to suboptimal healthcare outcomes. Telemedicine was a successful tool for physician oversight under movement control measures implemented during the COVID-19 pandemic and may continue to prove useful in the 'new normal' era of healthcare delivery for HD patients in community-based dialysis centres, operated by the National Kidney Foundation in Singapore.",2020-10-01,"Singh, Tripti; Ngoh, Clara Ly; Wong, Kin; Khan, Behram Ali","Annals of the Academy of Medicine, Singapore",,,,,,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33283839/,227520570.0

Data on the prevalence and frequency of these encounters are lacking and are needed to guide the creation of institutional trainings and policies to support trainees. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the frequency of resident experiences with and responses to a range of biased patient behaviors. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: A retrospective survey was sent via email to 331 second- and third-year internal medicine residents from 3 academic medical centers in California and North Carolina. First-year residents were excluded owing to their limited interactions with patients at the time of participant recruitment. Data were collected from August 21 to November 25, 2019. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Descriptive statistics were used to report the frequency of experience of various types of biased patient behavior, residents’ responses, the factors impeding residents’ responses, and residents’ experiences and beliefs regarding training and policies. RESULTS: Overall, 232 of 331 residents (70%) participated; 116 (50%) were women; 116 of 247 (47%) were White (participants had the option of selecting >1 race/ethnicity); and 23 (10%) identified as lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, or queer. The frequency of resident-reported experience of types of biased patient behaviors varied. The most common behaviors—belittling comments and assumption of nonphysician status—were reported to be experienced 1 or more times per week by 14% of residents (32 of 231) and 17% of residents (38 of 230), respectively. Women, Black or Latinx, and Asian residents reported experiencing biased behavior more frequently. Forty-five percent of Black or Latinx residents (17 of 38) encountered instances of explicit epithets or rejection of care. All 70 Asian residents reported experiencing inquiries into their ethnic origins. Most women residents (110 of 115 [96%]) experienced role questioning behaviors, and 87% (100 of 115) experienced sexual harassment. The need to prioritize clinical care and a sense of futility in responding were the most common factors (cited by 34% of residents [76 of 227] and 25% of residents [56 of 227], respectively) significantly impeding responses to biased behaviors. Eighty-five percent of residents (191 of 226) never reported incidents to their institution. Eighty-nine percent of residents (206 of 232) identified training and policies as necessary or very necessary. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: This survey study suggests that biased patient behavior is experienced frequently by internal medicine residents. Non-White and women residents reported experiencing a disproportionate burden of these incidents. Residents’ responses rarely included institutional involvement.

In a randomized controlled trial, eight mildly hypertriglyceridemic patients and five healthy, normolipidemic controls received three separate standardized fat-meals containing either saturated fatty acids (SFA), mono-unsaturated fatty acids (MUFA), or medium-chain fatty acids (MCFA) in a randomized order. Fasting and postprandial lipid parameters were determined over a 10 h period and the (incremental) area under the curve (AUC/iAUC) for plasma triglycerides and other parameters were determined.

RESULTS Of the planned 66 participants, we enrolled 44 (stopped due to coronavirus disease 2019-related obstacles), and 41 (19 mifepristone; 22 placebo) completed the study. We placed two or more additional dilators compared to standard in seven (36.8%) and three (13.6%) participants after mifepristone and placebo, respectively (p=0.14). We measured greater median initial cervical dilation in the mifepristone (3.2 cm[2.6-3.6]) compared to placebo (2.6 cm[2.2-3.0]) group, p=0.03. Surgeon's perception of procedure being ""easy"" (8/19[42.1] vs. 9/22[40.9], respectively, p=1.00) and complication rate (3/19[15.8%] vs. 3/22[13.6], respectively, p=1.00) did not differ. CONCLUSION Our underpowered study did not demonstrate a difference in cervical dilator placement, but mifepristone 18-24 hours prior to dilators increases cervical dilation without increasing complications. IMPLICATIONS Mifepristone 18-24 hours prior to cervical dilator placement may be a useful adjunct to cervical dilators based on increased cervical dilation at time of procedure; however, logistical barriers, such as an additional visit, may preclude routine adoption without definite clinical benefit.",2021-08-28,"Uhm, Suji; Mastey, Namrata; Baker, Courtney C; Chen, Melissa J; Matulich, Melissa C; Hou, Melody Y; Melo, Juliana; Wilson, Susan F; Creinin, Mitchell D",Contraception,,,,,,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.contraception.2021.08.013; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34464634/,237371807.0

DESIGN: cohort study. SETTING AND POPULATION: Mantua and Cremona provinces (Lombardy Region, Northern Italy) - included in ATS Val Padana - with COVID-19 incidence rate 7.5 and 16.9, respectively. Inhabitants aged >= 75 years as of 1st January 2018, 2019, and 2020 (three cohorts), stratified in NCH or not. The indicators calculated were: 1. rate ratio (RR) for NCH vs non-NCH, adjusted by gender, age, chronic diseases number, at least 1 hospitalisation, at least 1 Emergency room access in the previous year, for 2018, 2019, and 2020; 2. adjusted RR, 2019 and 2020 vs 2018, both sub-cohorts (i.e., NCH and non-NCH). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: first four-month period mortality of the considered years. RESULTS: aproximately 100,000 inhabitants by year, 7% in NCH. In the 2020 first four-month period, 4,343 deaths occurred of which 45% in NCH. RR in NCH population vs non-NCH for the year 2018 was 2.13 (95%CI 1.94-2.34); for the year 2019 was 2.70 (95%CI 2.43-3.00); for the year 2020 was 6.98 (95%CI 6,49-7,50). Adjusted RR for NCH population in 2020 vs 2018 was 2.22 (95%CI 2.05-2.42) in the whole ATS Val Padana; 1.58 (95%CI 1.40-1.77) in Mantua Province; 2.93 (2.62-3.27) in Cremona Province. Adjusted RR in non-NCH population in the year 2020 vs 2018 was 1.59 (95%CI 1.48-1.70) in the whole ATS; 1.34 (95%CI 1.23-1.46) in Mantua Province; 1.89 (95%CI 1.73-2.07) in Cremona Province. CONCLUSIONS: the NCH population experienced an excess risk mortality compared to non-NCH before the COVID-19; this excess increased during the outbreak. In 2020, in NCHs the risk was more than double compared to the 2018 risk, while in non-NCHs it rose approximately by 60%.

Additionally, SARS-CoV-2 may also elicit a cytokine storm, which accounts for disease progression and ultimately the urgent need of ventilator support.. Based upon several reports, it has been argued that early treatment with IFN-alpha2 or IFN-beta, preferentially in the early disease stage, may prohibit disease progression. Similarly, preliminary studies have shown that JAK1/2 inhibitor treatment with ruxolitinib or baricitinib may decrease mortality by dampening the deadly cytokine storm, which – in addition to the virus itself - also contributes to multi-organ thrombosis and multi-organ failure. Herein, we describe the rationale for treatment with IFNs (alpha2 or beta) and ruxolitinib emphasizing the urgent need to explore these agents in the treatment of SARS-CoV-2 – both as monotherapies and in combination. In this context we take advantage of several safety and efficacy studies in patients with the chronic myeloproliferative blood cancers (essential thrombocythemia, polycythemia vera and myelofibrosis) (MPNs), in whom IFN-alpha2 and ruxolitinib have been used successfully for the last 10 (ruxolitinib) to 30 years (IFN) as monotherapies and most recently in combination as well. In the context of these agents being highly immunomodulating (IFN boosting immune cells and JAK1/2 inhibitors being highly immunosuppressive and anti-inflammatory), we also discuss if statins and hydroxyurea, both agents possessing anti-inflammatory, antithrombotic and anviral potentials, might be inexpensive agents to be repurged in the treatment of SARS-CoV-2.",2021-04-14,"Hasselbalch, H.C.; Skov, V.; Kjær, L.; Ellervik, C.; Poulsen, A.; Poulsen, T.D.; Nielsen, C.H.",Cytokine Growth Factor Rev,,,,document_parses/pdf_json/0fa4f5ae63770d67062084cf1dab6823a24da80b.json,document_parses/pmc_json/PMC8045432.xml.json,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1359610121000332?v=s5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33992887/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1359610121000332; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cytogfr.2021.03.006,233235726.0

However, humans encountered other coronaviruses in the past, and they caused a broad range of symptoms, from mild to life-threatening, depending on the virus and immunocompetence of the host. Most human coronaviruses interact with the proteins and/or double-membrane vesicles of autophagy, the membrane trafficking pathway that degrades and recycles the intracellular protein aggregates, organelles, and pathogens, including viruses. However, coronaviruses often neutralize and hijack this pathway to complete their life cycle. In this review, we discuss the interactions of human coronaviruses and autophagy, including recent data from SARS-CoV-2-related studies. Some of these interactions (for example, viral block of the autophagosome–lysosome fusion), while being conserved across multiple coronaviruses, are accomplished via different molecular mechanisms.

Within cities the incidence of infection withSARS-CoV-2 is heterogeneously distributed across districts. Passing a certain level of incidence leads to lockdownrestrictions for cities and some specific to city districts. The restrictions have resulted in an increased importance of theneighbourhood. The structure of urban neighbourhoods as well as their environmental quality varies;some neighbourhoodsmay be in a better position to weather a pandemic. Urban planning instruments and strategies can improve neighbourhoodspatial structure and environmental quality, and so increase resilience. Methods The aims of this project are to identify neighbourhoods that are vulnerable because of conditions that promotevirus spread as well as those that amplify the impact of lockdown restrictions and to examine the suitability of urbanplanning instruments and strategies to increase neighbourhood resilience. For a selection of German cities different types ofneighbourhoods were examined to assess likely risks as well as the potential adaptability of urban structures. Results Built environment and socio-economic as well as other health-related characteristics were selected based on ascientific literature review and the state of the art in planning practice. A set of criteria for these characteristics wasdeveloped which forms the basis of a stress test. Five case study neighbourhoods were assessed using the stress test toidentify areas where urban development instruments and strategies should be implemented.

It is now recognized that patients may develop multisystem disease that spans multiple medical subspecialties. Here, we describe the findings from a large single center longitudinal cohort of 60 patients, the broad phenotypic presentation, as well as highlight the cohort’s experience with hematopoietic cell transplantation and COVID-19. Disease manifestations could be separated into three major phenotypes: inflammatory/vascular, immune dysregulatory, and hematologic, however, most patients presented with significant overlap between these three phenotype groups. The cardinal features of the inflammatory/vascular group included cutaneous manifestations and stroke. Evidence of immune dysregulation was commonly observed, including hypogammaglobulinemia, absent to low class-switched memory B cells, and inadequate response to vaccination. Despite these findings, infectious complications were exceedingly rare in this cohort. Hematologic findings including pure red cell aplasia (PRCA), immune-mediated neutropenia, and pancytopenia were observed in half of patients. We significantly extended our experience using anti-TNF agents, with no strokes observed in 2026 patient months on TNF inhibitors. Meanwhile, hematologic and immune features had a more varied response to anti-TNF therapy. Six patients received a total of 10 allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplant (HCT) procedures, with secondary graft failure necessitating repeat HCTs in three patients, as well as unplanned donor cell infusions to avoid graft rejection. All transplanted patients had been on anti-TNF agents prior to HCT and received varying degrees of reduced-intensity or non-myeloablative conditioning.

It is urgent to understand the function of viral genes. However, the function of open reading frame 10 (ORF10), which is uniquely expressed by SARS-CoV-2, remains unclear. In this study, we showed that overexpression of ORF10 markedly suppressed the expression of type I interferon (IFN-I) genes and IFN-stimulated genes. Then, mitochondrial antiviral signaling protein (MAVS) was identified as the target via which ORF10 suppresses the IFN-I signaling pathway, and MAVS was found to be degraded through the ORF10-induced autophagy pathway. Furthermore, overexpression of ORF10 promoted the accumulation of LC3 in mitochondria and induced mitophagy. Mechanistically, ORF10 was translocated to mitochondria by interacting with the mitophagy receptor Nip3-like protein X (NIX) and induced mitophagy through its interaction with both NIX and LC3B. Moreover, knockdown of NIX expression blocked mitophagy activation, MAVS degradation, and IFN-I signaling pathway inhibition by ORF10. Consistent with our observations, in the context of SARS-CoV-2 infection, ORF10 inhibited MAVS expression and facilitated viral replication. In brief, our results reveal a novel mechanism by which SARS-CoV-2 inhibits the innate immune response; that is, ORF10 induces mitophagy-mediated MAVS degradation by binding to NIX.",2021-11-29,"Li, Xingyu; Hou, Peili; Ma, Wenqing; Wang, Xuefeng; Wang, Hongmei; Yu, Zhangping; Chang, Huasong; Wang, Tiecheng; Jin, Song; Wang, Xue; Wang, Wenqi; Zhao, Yudong; Zhao, Yong; Xu, Chunqing; Ma, Xiaomei; Gao, Yuwei; He, Hongbin",Cell Mol Immunol,,,,document_parses/pdf_json/047ca45f8b02f0e606c381927362c09c82173df2.json,document_parses/pmc_json/PMC8628139.xml.json,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34845370/; https://doi.org/10.1038/s41423-021-00807-4,244728959.0

More than 1,051,635 confirmed cases (and counting) have been reported worldwide, thus far, and both local and international travelers are considered to represent populations at high risk of acquiring the infection. Many factors are involved in the spread of this viral agent, including travel to and from endemic areas, a history of contact with a traveler from an endemic country, the virus infection rate at the destination, individual health, and inadequate prevention and control measures. COVID-19 symptoms range from fever and cough to difficulty breathing, and more severe cases can present with pneumonia and multi-organ failure. The virus is thought to be transmitted through large respiratory droplets, generated by coughing or sneezing and transmitted through close contact with infected persons or contaminated surfaces. Diagnostic strategies include the assays for the detection of antiviral antibodies, multiplex nucleic acid amplification, and microarray-based assays. Currently, no approved antiviral therapy or vaccine exists to treat or prevent the infection. Public health measures, such as quarantine, have been enforced, to slow the community spread of the virus, by governments, worldwide. The World Health Organization (WHO) and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) have recommended COVID-19 infection screening be performed at airports, for all travelers, before traveling to endemic countries and the restriction of travel to countries more than one thousand cases of infection.

Methods We conducted a cohort study using eight routinely-collected healthcare databases from Spain and the US, standardized to the Observational Medical Outcome Partnership common data model. Three cohorts of patients with a history of cancer were included: i) diagnosed with COVID-19, ii) hospitalized with COVID-19, and iii) hospitalized with influenza in 2017-2018. Patients were followed from index date to 30 days or death. We reported demographics, cancer subtypes, comorbidities, and 30-day outcomes. Results We included 118,155 patients with a cancer history in the COVID-19 diagnosed and 41,939 in the COVID-19 hospitalized cohorts. The most frequent cancer subtypes were prostate and breast cancer (range: 5-19% and 1-14% in the diagnosed cohort, respectively). Hematological malignancies were also frequent, with non-Hodgkin lymphoma being among the 5 most common cancer subtypes in the diagnosed cohort.

Owing to its high prevalence and detrimental impact on personal, social, and economic aspects of patient lives, much desire has gone into fully understanding the pathogenesis of migraine, and to search for therapeutic agents. In addition to current therapeutics such as triptans, ergotamine, and monoclonal antibodies targeting calcitonin gene-related peptide receptors, vitamin B12 has been investigated for its possible use as a prophylactic agent for migraines. Specifically, the observed effects of vitamin B12 on nitric oxide and homocysteine prompt further investigation of its underlying mechanisms in migraine pathophysiology.

Optimization of existing rapid tests in whole blood will require significant effort in the short-term and there is a need for solutions to help bridge the gap in performance between plasma and whole blood. We demonstrate here the implementation of the H.E.R.M.E.S platform, a portable plasma separation system that can enhance the performance of blood-based diagnostic testing, with a commercially available SARS-COV-2 IgG/IgM serology rapid diagnostic test (RDT) in a blinded study with 61 human samples.

An important coronaviral drug target for treatment of COVID-19 is the conserved main protease (Mpro). Nirmatrelvir is a potent Mpro inhibitor and the antiviral component of Paxlovid™. The significant viral sequencing effort during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic represented a unique opportunity to assess potential nirmatrelvir escape mutations from emerging variants of SARS-CoV-2. To establish the baseline mutational landscape of Mpro prior to the introduction of Mpro inhibitors, Mpro sequences and its cleavage junction regions were retrieved from ∼4,892,000 high-quality SARS-CoV-2 genomes in GISAID. Any mutations identified from comparison to the reference sequence (Wuhan-hu-1) were cataloged and analyzed. Mutations at sites key to nirmatrelvir binding and protease functionality (e.g., dimerization sites) were still rare. Structural comparison of Mpro also showed conservation of key nirmatrelvir contact residues across the extended Coronaviridae family (alpha-, beta-, and gamma-coronaviruses). Additionally, we showed that over time the SARS-CoV-2 Mpro enzyme remained under purifying selection and was highly conserved relative to the spike protein. Now, with the EUA approval of Paxlovid and its expected widespread use across the globe, it is essential to continue large-scale genomic surveillance of SARS-CoV-2 Mpro evolution. This study establishes a robust analysis framework for monitoring emergent mutations in millions of virus isolates, with the goal of identifying potential resistance to present and future SARS-CoV-2 antivirals. Importance The recent authorization of oral SARS-CoV-2 antivirals, such as Paxlovid, has ushered in a new era of the COVID-19 pandemic. Emergence of new variants, as well as selective pressure imposed by antiviral drugs themselves, raise concern for potential escape mutations in key drug binding motifs. To determine the potential emergence of antiviral resistance in globally circulating isolates and its implications for the clinical response to the COVID-19 pandemic, sequencing of SARS-CoV-2 viral isolates before, during, and after the introduction of new antiviral treatments is critical. The infrastructure built herein for active genetic surveillance of Mpro evolution and emergent mutations will play an important role in assessing potential antiviral resistance as the pandemic progresses and Mpro inhibitors are introduced. We anticipate our framework to be the starting point in a larger effort for global monitoring of the SARS-CoV-2 Mpro mutational landscape.",2022-03-30,"Lee, Jonathan T.; Yang, Qingyi; Gribenko, Alexey; Perrin, B.

Growing evidence suggests that individuals with pre-existing comorbidities are at higher risk of a more serious COVID-19 illness. Sickle cell disease (SCD) is an inherited hemoglobinopathy which increases the susceptibility to infections and as a consequent has higher risks of morbidity and mortality. The impact of COVID-19 on SCD patients could lead to further increase in disease severity and mortality. Studies that examine the effect of SCD on COVID-19 outcomes are lacking. This study aims to determine whether SCD is a risk factor for severe COVID-19 infection in regards to the requirement of non-invasive ventilation/high flow nasal cannula (NIV/HFNC), mechanical intubation (MV) or death. Methods: Retrospective cohort study which included COVID-19 patients admitted to four Ministry of Health COVID-19 treatment facilities in Bahrain during the period of 24, February 2020, to 31, July 2020. All SCD patients with COVID-19 were included and compared to randomly selected non-SCD patients with COVID-19. Data for the selected patients were collected from the medical records. Multivariate logistic regression models were used to control for confounders and estimate the effect of SCD on the outcomes. Results: A total of 1,792 patients with COVID-19 were included; 38 of whom were diagnosed with SCD as well. In the SCD group, one (2.6%) patient required NIV/HFNC, one (2.6%) required MV and one (2.6%) death occurred. In comparison, 56 (3.2%) of the non-SCD patients required NIV/HFNC, 47 (2.7%) required MV and death occurred in 58 (3.3%) patients. Upon adjusting for confounders, SCD had an odds ratio of 1.847 (95% CI: 0.39 - 8.83; p=0.442).

Design/setting: Monthly cross-sectional surveys representative of the adult population in England, aggregated before (April 2019 through February 2020) versus after (April 2020) the lockdown. Participants: 20,558 adults ([â¥]16y). Measurements: The independent variable was the timing of the Covid-19 lockdown in England (before vs. after March 2020). Dependent variables were: prevalence of smoking and high-risk drinking; past-year cessation and quit attempts (among past-year smokers); past-year attempts to reduce alcohol consumption (among high-risk drinkers); and use of evidence-based (e.g., prescription medication/face-to-face behavioural support) and remote support (telephone support/websites/apps) for smoking cessation and alcohol reduction (among smokers/high-risk drinkers who made a quit/reduction attempt). Covariates included age, sex, social grade, region, and level of nicotine and alcohol dependence (as relevant). Findings: The Covid-19 lockdown was not associated with a significant change in smoking prevalence (17.0% (after) vs. 15.9% (before), OR=1.09[95%CI 0.95-1.24]), but was associated with increases in the rate of quit attempts (39.6% vs. 29.1%, ORadj=1.56[1.23-1.98]) and cessation (8.8% vs. 4.1%, ORadj=2.63[1.69-4.09]) among past-year smokers. Among smokers who tried to quit, there was no significant change in use of evidence-based support (50.0% vs. 51.5%, ORadj=1.10[0.72-1.68]) but use of remote support increased (10.9% vs. 2.7%, ORadj=3.59[1.56-8.23]). Lockdown was associated with increases in the prevalence of high-risk drinking (38.3% vs. 25.1%, OR=1.85[1.67-2.06]) but also alcohol reduction attempts by high-risk drinkers (28.5% vs. 15.3%, ORadj=2.16[1.77-2.64]). Among high-risk drinkers who made a reduction attempt, use of evidence-based support decreased (1.2% vs. 4.0%, ORadj=0.23[0.05-0.97]) and there was no significant change in use of remote support (6.9% vs. 6.1%, ORadj=1.32[0.64-2.75]). Conclusions: In England, prevalence of high-risk drinking but not smoking has increased since the Covid-19 lockdown. Smokers and high-risk drinkers are more likely than before lockdown to report trying to quit smoking or reduce their alcohol consumption, and rates of smoking cessation are higher. Smokers are no less likely than before lockdown to use cessation support, with increased uptake of remote support. However, use of evidence-based support for alcohol reduction by high-risk drinkers has decreased, with no compensatory increase in use of remote support.",2020-05-27,"Jackson, Sarah E; Garnett, Claire; Shahab, Lion; Oldham, Melissa; Brown, Jamie",,,#20112656,,,,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.05.25.20112656; http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.05.25.20112656v1?rss=1,218900077.0

Another reduction that has been reported is in the number of strokes presenting to hospitals, despite the virus implicated in causing a hypercoagulable state. Acute exposure to air pollution has been linked to increase in stroke incidence and the improvement in air quality may be responsible for the decrease in stroke presentations. MATERIALS AND METHODS: To explore this hypothesis, we compared the air quality index (AQI) of Karachi, the largest cosmopolitan city of Pakistan, during the lockdown period in 2020 to the same period in the previous year. RESULTS: We found a significant drop in AQI depicting an improvement in air quality. Simultaneously, we identified a drop in number of stroke admissions to less than half from 2019 to 2020 at one of the largest tertiary care hospitals of the city, during this period of interest. CONCLUSION: We hypothesize that one important reason for this drop in stroke admissions, may be an actual reduction in stroke incidence brought about by an improvement in air quality.",2021,"Hameed, Sajid; Khan, Maria; Fatmi, Zafar; Wasay, Mohammad",J Stroke Cerebrovasc Dis,,#1240473,,,,,234098876.0

It builds a conceptual bridge and discusses the opportunity to capitalise on the missing link between the pre-COVID overtourism and the post-COVID “undertourism” debates. Design/methodology/approach: A cross-fertilisation between the overtourism knowledge and the emerging COVID-19 literature stream is proposed and supported by an online media analysis focussing on the Italian tourism debate on Twitter. A text analysis of 2,500 posts helps discuss the conceptual framework. Findings: The analysed Twitter debate prioritised socio-economic impacts, regulative actions and the recovery approach, representing government as the pivotal actor to overcome the pandemic crisis. An integrative interpretative framework results from this research, opening three areas of inquiry, such as the recovery–reform continuum, managerial approaches beyond regulative frames of action and a critical sizing of digital technologies deployment. Research limitations/implications: Samples with different geographical and temporal coverage may provide further and multifaceted insights into the emerging tourism online media debate. Originality/value: An original conceptualisation counter-intuitively frames post-pandemic tourism scenarios.

While both IDR structures were found in alpha, beta, and gamma-coronaviruses, the second IDR was absent in deltacoronaviruses. Two novel coronaviruses, currently placed in the Gammacoronavirus genus, appeared intermediate in this regard, as the second IDR structure could be barely discerned with a low probability of disorder. Interestingly, these two are the only coronaviruses thus far isolated from marine mammals, namely beluga whale and bottlenose dolphin, two highly related species; the N proteins of the viruses were also virtually identical, differing by a single amino acid. These two unique viruses remain phylogenetic oddities, since gammacoronaviruses are generally avian (bird) in nature. Lastly, both IDRs, regardless of the coronavirus genus in which they occurred, were rich in Ser and Arg, in agreement with their disordered structure.

We analyze the risk and intensity of the decline in the values of the basic stock indices by means of selected methods of survival analysis. The spreading pandemic within a few months covered all continents and had a significant impact on the socio-economic situation of all countries. We studied the time of the 20% drop in stock market indices. This is a value that is taken as a sign of a crisis. In order to assess the probability of indices’ value decrease, we use the Kaplan–Meier’s estimator. We determine the risk of decline by means of a logit model and the intensity of the decline by means of an empirical hazard estimator and the Cox proportional hazard model. The intensity and risk of the decline of stock indices varied from continent to continent. The obtained results show that the intensity is highest in the fourth and eighth week after the peak and is the highest on European exchanges and then American and Asian exchanges (including Australia). The risk of falling the stock indices’ prices is the highest in America, followed by Europe, Asia and Australia, and lowest in Africa.

RESULTS: A total of 483 patients (mean age 77 ± 14 years, 300 men (62%)) were included, and fifty-one patients (11%) died during admission. In univariate analysis, decreased thickness, area, and volume of the pectoralis major and minor muscles were associated with higher in-hospital mortality. Multivariate analysis with adjustment for age, gender, serum albumin, and A-DROP revealed that thinner pectoralis major and minor muscles were independent factors of poor prognosis (odds ratio: 0.878, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.783–0.985, P=0.026 and odds ratio: 0.842, 95% CI: 0.733–0.968, P=0.016, respectively).

cm6530lr,,WHO,Evaluation of three rapid lateral flow antigen detection tests for the diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection,,,,unk,"INTRODUCTION: The COVID-19 pandemic has led to high demand of diagnostic tools. Rapid antigen detection tests have been developed and many have received regulatory acceptance such as CE IVD or FDA markings. Their performance needs to be carefully assessed. MATERIALS AND METHODS: 158 positive and 40 negative retrospective samples collected in saline and analyzed by a laboratory-developed RT-PCR test were used to evaluate Sofia (Quidel), Standard Q (SD Biosensor), and Panbio&#8482; (Abbott) rapid antigen detection tests (RADTs). A subset of the specimens was subjected to virus culture. RESULTS: The specificity of all RADTs was 100 % and the sensitivity and percent agreement was 80 % and 85 % for Sofia, 81 % and 85 % for Standard Q, and 83 % and 86 % for Panbio&#8482;, respectively. All three RADTs evaluated in this study reached a more than 90 % sensitivity for samples with a high viral load as estimated from the low Ct (Cycle threshold) values in the reference RT-PCR. Virus culture was successful in 80 % of specimens with a Ct value <25. CONCLUSIONS: As expected, the RADTs were less sensitive than RT-PCR. However, they benefit from the speed and ease of testing, and lower price as compared to RT-PCR.

Hence, this study assessed the prevalence of mental health symptoms as well as emotional reactions among sub-Saharan Africans (SSAs) and associated factors among SSAs during the COVID-19 lockdown period. This was a web-based cross-sectional study on mental health and emotional features from 2005 respondents in seven SSA countries. This study was conducted between 17 April and 17 May 2020 corresponding to the lockdown period in most SSA countries. Respondents aged 18 years and above and the self-reported symptoms were feeling anxious, being worried, angry, bored and frustrated. These were the main outcomes and were treated as dichotomous variables. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were used to identify the factors associated with these symptoms. We found that over half (52.2%) of the participants reported any of the mental health symptoms and the prevalence of feeling bored was 70.5% followed by feeling anxious (59.1%), being worried (57.5%), frustrated (51.5%) and angry (22.3%) during the COVID-19 pandemic. Multivariate analysis revealed that males, those aged >28 years, those who lived in Central and Southern Africa, those who were not married, the unemployed, those living with more than six persons in a household, had higher odds of mental health and emotional symptoms. Similarly, people who perceived low risk of contracting the infection, and those who thought the pandemic would not continue after the lockdown had higher odds of mental health and emotional symptoms. Health care workers had lower odds for feeling angry than non-healthcare workers. During the COVID-19 lockdown periods in SSA, about one in two participants reported mental health and emotional symptoms. Public health measures can be effectively used to identify target groups for prevention and treatment of mental health and emotional symptoms.

Safety precautions limited in-person urgent care options, despite high patient demand. This study describes how one children's health system redeployed clinical health professionals to expand existing pediatric, urgent care, on-demand telemedicine in the early months of the United States' pandemic response. Patient utilization and visit characteristics during the pandemic are contextualized relative to pre-pandemic, business-as-usual (BAU) operations. Materials and Methods: This IRB-approved study is a descriptive, retrospective analysis. Key elements of the clinician redeployment process and shift in physician workflow are described. Retrospective data analysis included routine patient and visit characteristics for urgent care, on-demand telemedicine services received January to May 2020. BAU represented telemedicine encounters between January and May 2019. Results: Twenty-eight redeployed pediatricians and advanced practice registered nurses were trained and credentialed to assist the on-demand pediatrician team on the existing telemedicine platform. During 2020, providers completed 5,055 telemedicine visits, a 168% increase over the same timeframe in 2019. Pre-pandemic visit wait time was 6.29 ± 5.4 min, which increased to 23.25 ± 34.30 min during 2020. Top chief complaints included skin-related concerns (27.9%) and upper respiratory infections (20.2%) and were consistent across years. Patient satisfaction with provider and platform were high. Discussion: By engaging and training redeployed clinicians during the pandemic response, health care access was maintained for thousands of patients.

We describe the long-term patterns of paediatric disease associated with three of these viruses, HCoV-NL63, OC43 and 229E, in coastal Kenya. Methods: Continuous surveillance of pneumonia admissions was conducted at the Kilifi county hospital (KCH) located in the northern coastal region of Kenya. Children aged &lt;5 years admitted to KCH with clinically defined syndromic severe or very severe pneumonia were recruited. Respiratory samples were taken and tested for 15 virus targets, using real-time polymerase chain reaction. Unadjusted odds ratios were used to estimate the association between demographic and clinical characteristics and HCoV positivity. Results: From 2007 to 2019, we observed 11,445 pneumonia admissions, of which 314 (3.9%) tested positive for at least one HCoV type. There were 129 (41.1%) OC43, 99 (31.5%) 229E, 74 (23.6%) NL63 positive cases and 12 (3.8%) cases of HCoV to HCoV coinfection. Among HCoV positive cases, 47% (n=147) were coinfected with other respiratory virus pathogens. The majority of HCoV cases were among children aged &lt;1 year (66%, n=208), though there was no age-dependence in the proportion testing positive. HCoV-OC43 was predominant of the three HCoV types throughout the surveillance period. Evidence for seasonality was not identified. Conclusions: Overall, 4% of paediatric pneumonia admissions were associated with three endemic HCoVs, with a high proportion of cases co-occurring with another respiratory virus, with no clear seasonal pattern, and with the age-distribution of cases following that of pneumonia admissions (i.e. highest in infants). These observations suggest, at most, a small severe disease contribution of endemic HCoVs in this tropical setting and offer insight into the potential future burden and epidemiological characteristics of SARS-CoV-2.",2020,"Otieno, Grieven P.; Murunga, Nickson; Agoti, Charles N.; Gallagher, Katherine E.; Awori, Juliet O.; Nokes, D.

It is connected wirelessly to any type of smartphone and it is used by asthma patients to self-monitor progress of their clinical condition. Thus evaluation of the SPF's ability to provide accurate PEF values is essential. The aim of this pilot work was to provide preliminary in-vivo data about the measurement agreement between the SPF and a lab spirometer for a first time. Methods: PEF measurements were obtained by 9 healthy adults as this pilot work was terminated earlier than it was expected due to COVID-19 restrictions. PEF readings (n=27) were recorded by the comparable devices at the same time during three different expiratory maneuvers performed by each participant. The Bland and Altman plot was used to assess the agreement. Results: Good agreement between the SPF and the lab spirometer was found with the mean bias being estimated 0.29 L/min. The lower and upper limits of agreement (LOA) were estimated 30.03 L/min and -30.61 L/min respectively.

Methods: This study involved a cross-sectional, nonrepresentative, online survey in the United States of individuals tested for COVID-19. Testing survey items measured the performance of conventional contact tracing programs, quantified the stigma related to the notification of COVID-19 close contacts, and assessed the acceptability of a website service for digital contact tracing. Results: A sample of 668 (19.9%) individuals met the inclusion criteria and consented to participation. Among the 95 participants with COVID-19, results were received after a median of 2 days, 63.2% interacted with a contact tracing program a median of 2 days after receiving test results, 62.1% had close contacts, and 37.1% of participants with COVID-19 and close contacts did not disclose their results to all close contacts. Among all participants, 17% had downloaded a mobile application and 40.3% reported interest in a website service. One hundred and nine participants perceived stigma with the disclosure of COVID-19 test results; of these, 58.7% reported that a website service for close contact notification would decrease this stigma. Discussion: Conventional contact tracing programs did not comprehensively contact individuals who tested positive for COVID-19 nor did so within a meaningful time frame. Digital contact tracing innovations may address these shortcomings; however, the low penetration of mobile application services in the United States indicates that a suite of digital contact tracing tools, including website services, are warranted for a more exhaustive coverage of the population.

However, there is currently little specific guidance for deciding when patients with COVID-19 require hospitalisation and when they may be safely observed as an outpatient. METHODS In this retrospective study, we characterised all patients with COVID-19 discharged home from EDs in our US multisite healthcare system from March 2020 to August 2020, focusing on individuals who returned within 2 weeks and required hospital admission. We restricted analyses to first-encounter data that do not depend on laboratory or imaging diagnostics in order to inform point-of-care assessments in resource-limited environments. Vitals and comorbidities were extracted from the electronic health record. We performed ordinal logistic regression analyses to identify predictors of inpatient admission, intensive care and intubation. RESULTS Of n=923 patients who were COVID-19 positive discharged from the ED, n=107 (11.6%) returned within 2 weeks and were admitted. In a multivariable-adjusted model including n=788 patients with complete risk factor information, history of hypertension increased odds of hospitalisation and severe illness by 1.92-fold (95% CI 1.07 to 3.41), diabetes by 2.20-fold (1.18 to 4.02), chronic lung disease by 2.21-fold (1.22 to 3.92) and fever by 2.89-fold (1.71 to 4.82). Having at least two of these risk factors increased the odds of future hospitalisation by 6.68-fold (3.54 to 12.70). Patients with hypertension, diabetes, chronic lung disease or fever had significantly longer hospital stays (median 5.92 days, 3.08-10.95 vs 3.21, 1.10-5.75, p<0.01) with numerically higher but not significantly different rates of intensive care unit admission (27.02% vs 14.30%, p=0.27) and intubation (12.16% vs 7.14%, p=0.71). DISCUSSION Patients infected with COVID-19 may appear clinically safe for home convalescence.

However, because of epidemiology of disease and regional differences in approaches to patient care, global application of PoCUS might not be possible. Before creating a PoCUS teaching course, it is critical to perform a needs analysis and recognize the training obstacles. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A validated online questionnaire was given to final-year medical students at our institution to evaluate their perceptions of the applicability of specific clinical findings, and their own capability to detect these signs clinically and with PoCUS. The skill insufficiency was assessed by deducting the self-reported clinical and ultrasound skill level from the perceived usefulness of each clinical finding. RESULTS: The levels of expertise and knowledge in the 229 students who participated were not up to the expected standard. The applicability of detection of abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) (3.9 ± standard deviation [SD] 1.4) was the highest. However, detection of interstitial syndrome (3.0 ± SD 1.1) was perceived as the least applicable. The deficit was highest in the detection of AAA (mean 0.95 ± SD 2.4) and lowest for hepatomegaly (mean 0.57 ± SD 2.3). Although the majority agreed that training of preclinical and clinical medical students would be beneficial, 52 (22.7%) showed no interest, and 60% (n = 136) reported that they did not have the time to develop the skill. CONCLUSION: Although medical students in Saudi Arabia claim that PoCUS is an important skill, there are significant gaps in their skill, indicating the need for PoCUS training.

We circulated a google form with informed consent on the hospital WhatsApp platform and asked them to self-report their vaccination experience. Results: Two thirds (69.7% (152/218),95% CI: 63.1-75.7) had minor AEFI, and none had severe AEFI. Body ache (46.8%, 95% CI:40-53.6) was the most common symptom followed by headache (30.3%, 95% CI: 24.2-36.8) and fever (22%,95% CI: 16.8-28.1). Most of them (39.4%, 95% CI:32.9-46.2) experienced symptoms within 4-24 hours after taking the vaccine while 22.3% (95% CI:17.1-28.6)experienced it after a day. Majority of the HCWs (78.9% 95% CI: 72.8-84.1) were anxious before the vaccination. Younger age group and female gender were significantly associated with AEFI compared to their counterparts. Conclusion: HCWs experienced minor, self-limiting AEFI with the first dose of ChAdOx1nCoV-19. The hospital reported no serious AEFI following the vaccination.",2021-03-24,"Inbaraj, L.

Along this line of research, temporal network has come out to be one of the most promising network platforms to investigate. Especially, such network with spatially moving agents has been established to be capable of modelling a number of practical instances. In this paper, we examine the dynamical outcomes of moving agents interacting based upon their physical proximity. For this, we particularly emphasize on the impact of competing interactions among the agents depending on their physical distance. We specifically assume attractive coupling between agents which are staying apart from each other, whereas we adopt repulsive interaction for agents that are sufficiently close in space. With this set-up, we consider two types of coupling configurations, symmetry-breaking and symmetry-preserving couplings. We encounter variants of collective dynamics ranging from synchronization, inhomogeneous small oscillation to cluster state and extreme events while changing the attractive and repulsive coupling strengths. We have been able to map all these dynamical behaviors in the coupling parameter space. Complete synchronization being the most desired state in absence of repulsive coupling, we present an analytical study for this scenario that agrees well with the numerical results.",2020-08-17,"Chowdhury, Sayantan Nag; Majhi, Soumen; Ghosh, Dibakar",,,,2008.07058,document_parses/pdf_json/1018afac20d3d543d06c183af40f4509705e8a6e.json,,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2008.07058v1.pdf,221139837.0

cns57v65,,WHO,The Impacts and Implications of the COVID-19 Pandemic on the Global Response to Climate Change,,,,unk,"The coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic has posed the most severe impact on the global economy and society since World War II. The pandemic has brought into focus how climate change is related with virus transmission and health, and has made the global transition toward low-carbon development more difficult and challenged the implementation of the Paris Agreement. Although the pandemic has significantly reduced carbon emissions and improved the environmental quality in the short term, it is still an unwanted event in the process of pursuing sustainable development;although objectively the pandemic has weakened countries’ efforts in terms of policies and actions to address climate change, the restructuring of global value chains in the post-COVID era has also brought new opportunities for a transition toward green and low-carbon development;although the pandemic has warned people of how important resilient governance and international cooperation is to addressing the crisis, the global climate governance process has come to a complete standstill since the outbreak of COVID-19, attenuating the mutual trust among countries and disabling the leadership in climate governance. The pandemic is a preview of the climate crisis, and it is important to learn from it for a better response. China quickly contained the pandemic within the country, actively resumed work and production, and gained a first-mover advantage in economic recovery. China should maintain strategic focus when pursuing ecological development, enhance the resilience of the socio-economic system, seize the opportunity of transitioning toward low-carbon development by turning the crisis into opportunities, and promote high-quality development within the country while fully engaging in global climate governance to seek ecological progress with other countries.

They were produced by the cold-ethanol fractionation methods and did not make an exception. Noninfectious severe AEs occurred while infectious AEs were rarely reported. Indeed, prior to the introduction of mass screening for infection markers of plasma donations, inadvertent transmission of HIV to recipients of factor VIII and factor IX concentrates did occur, while IgG concentrates obtained from the same plasma pool did rarely transmit HIV (Morgenthaler 2001). Rare transmissions were restricted to products not exposed to low pH. The very few incidences of HIV and some incidences of HCV transmission by IgG concentrates in the early 1990s together with many cases of coagulation factor concentrates transmitted viral disease clearly demonstrated the need to establish standardized measures to render plasma products pathogen safe. In the second half of the 1990s, authorities shifted regulatory emphasis from a scientific review of the processes to a focus on compliance to current good manufacturing practice (cGMP). The focus on cGMP compliance was applied to all aspects of plasma fractionation and the clinical use of plasma products. Court injunctions and warning letters were the consequences of this paradigm shift by authorities.

Patient trajectories are highly predictive of the future course of diseases and therefore facilitate effective care. However, digital medicine often uses only limited patient data, consisting of health events from only a single or small number of time points while ignoring additional information encoded in patient trajectories. To analyze such rich longitudinal data, new artificial intelligence (AI) solutions are needed. In this paper, we provide an overview of the recent efforts to develop trajectory-aware AI solutions and provide suggestions for future directions. Specifically, we examine the implications for developing disease models from patient trajectories along the typical workflow in AI: problem definition, data processing, modeling, evaluation, and interpretation.

We retrospectively analysed a COVID-19 cohort recruited during the first 40 days of the epidemic in Italy. We examined the association between obesity and 30-day mortality, admission to ICU, mortality and length of hospital stay in patients with COVID-19. Methods and results Demographic, clinical and outcome data were retrospectively analyzed in 331 patients with COVID-19 admitted to hospital between 21 February and 31 March 2020. The predictive effect of obesity on mortality was assessed using a Cox proportional-hazard regression model, its effect on ICU admission and mortality in the ICU using logistic regressions, and its effect on length of hospital stay using a linear regression. Seventy-four of 331 patients had a BMI ≥30 kg/m2. Among obese patients, 21 (28.4%) required admission in ICU and 25 died (33.8%). After controlling for sex, age, comorbidities and clinical data, obesity was not significantly associated with mortality, mortality in ICU and length of hospital stay. The effect of obesity on ICU admission remained significant after controlling for sex, age, interstitial lung disease, heart disease and serum C-reactive protein.

With this method, the throughput and service level of the warehouse can be improved, while keeping the number of workers constant. Numerical results with real data demonstrate the reduction of discrepancy between inbound and outbound service level performance.

5vb5iphk,,WHO,Rapid Transition to Telehealth and the Digital Divide: Implications for Primary Care Access and Equity in a Post-COVID Era,,,,unk,"Policy Points Telehealth has many potential advantages during an infectious disease outbreak such as the COVID-19 pandemic, and the COVID-19 pandemic has accelerated the shift to telehealth as a prominent care delivery mode. Not all health care providers and patients are equally ready to take part in the telehealth revolution, which raises concerns for health equity during and after the COVID-19 pandemic. Without proactive efforts to address both patient- and provider-related digital barriers associated with socioeconomic status, the wide-scale implementation of telehealth amid COVID-19 may reinforce disparities in health access in already marginalized and underserved communities. To ensure greater telehealth equity, policy changes should address barriers faced overwhelmingly by marginalized patient populations and those who serve them. CONTEXT: The COVID-19 pandemic has catalyzed fundamental shifts across the US health care delivery system, including a rapid transition to telehealth. Telehealth has many potential advantages, including maintaining critical access to care while keeping both patients and providers safe from unnecessary exposure to the coronavirus. However, not all health care providers and patients are equally ready to take part in this digital revolution, which raises concerns for health equity during and after the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: The study analyzed data about small primary care practices' telehealth use and barriers to telehealth use collected from rapid-response surveys administered by the New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene's Bureau of Equitable Health Systems and New York University from mid-April through mid-June 2020 as part of the city's efforts to understand how primary care practices were responding to the COVID-19 pandemic following New York State's stay-at-home order on March 22. We focused on small primary care practices because they represent 40% of primary care providers and are disproportionately located in low-income, minority or immigrant areas that were more severely impacted by COVID-19. To examine whether telehealth use and barriers differed based on the socioeconomic characteristics of the communities served by these practices, we used the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Social Vulnerability Index (SVI) to stratify respondents as being in high-SVI or low-SVI areas. We then characterized respondents' telehealth use and barriers to adoption by using means and proportions with 95% confidence intervals. In addition to a primary analysis using pooled data across the five waves of the survey, we performed sensitivity analyses using data from respondents who only took one survey, first wave only, and the last two waves only. FINDINGS: While all providers rapidly shifted to telehealth, there were differences based on community characteristics in both the primary mode of telehealth used and the types of barriers experienced by providers. Providers in high-SVI areas were almost twice as likely as providers in low-SVI areas to use telephones as their primary telehealth modality (41.7% vs 23.8%; P <.001). The opposite was true for video, which was used as the primary telehealth modality by 18.7% of providers in high-SVI areas and 33.7% of providers in low-SVI areas (P <0.001). Providers in high-SVI areas also faced more patient-related barriers and fewer provider-related barriers than those in low-SVI areas. CONCLUSIONS: Between April and June 2020, telehealth became a prominent mode of primary care delivery in New York City. However, the transition to telehealth did not unfold in the same manner across communities.

Specifically, I posit that by working with and alongside activist care workers, community psychologists can assist in building socially just modalities of care. After reflecting on my work with collective caring initiatives, I offer five (tentative) guiding principles for a community psychology that is committed to addressing the crisis of care, namely: (1) commitment to building political coalitions; (2) commitment to refuting capitalist conceptions of care; (3) commitment to expanding conceptions of care; (4) commitment to embracing the psychological consequences of care work; and (5) a politicoethical commitment.",2020,"Malherbe, Nick",J Community Psychol,,#713781,,,,,221122224.0

Real-time RT - PCR (Reverse transcription - Polymerase Chain Reaction) is used to amplify the viral RNA and enable its detection. Although PCR is 37 years old, it is still considered, without dispute, as the gold standard. PCR is an efficient process, but the complex engineering required for automated RNA extraction and temperature cycling makes it incompatible for use in point of care settings. In the present work, by harnessing progress made in the past two decades in DNA amplification, microfluidics and membrane technologies, we succeeded to create a portable test, in which SARS-CoV-2 RNA is extracted, amplified isothermally by RT - LAMP (Loop-mediated Isothermal Amplification), and detected using intercalating dyes or highly fluorescent probes. Depending on the viral load, the detection takes between twenty minutes and one hour. Using pools of naso-pharyngal clinical samples, we estimated a sensitivity comparable to RT-qPCR (up to a Cycle threshold of 39, equivalent to <0.1 TCID50 per mL) and a 100% specificity, for other human coronaviruses and eight respiratory viruses currently circulating in Europe. We designed and fabricated an easy-to-use portable device called COVIDISC to carry out the test at the point of care. The low cost of the materials along with the absence of complex equipment paves the way towards a large dissemination of this device. The perspective of a reliable SARS-CoV-2 point of care detection, highly performing, that would deliver on-site results in less than one hour opens up a new efficient approach to manage the pandemics.",2020-08-04,"Garneret, P.; Coz, E.; Martin, E.; Manuguerra, J.-C.; Brient-Litzler, E.; Enouf, V.; Gonzalez Obando, D.

METHODS: A retrospective study of children with HCoV detected by reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was performed for a community cohort and a children’s hospital in the same community from January 2013 to December 2014. The RT-PCR assay detected HCoV 229E, HKU1, NL63, and OC43 in nasal swabs from symptomatic children ≤18 years. Factors associated with increased severity of illness in hospitalized children were assessed by multivariable logistic regression. RESULTS: Human coronavirus was detected in 261 children, 49 and 212 from the community and hospital, respectively. The distribution of HCoV types and seasonal trends were similar in the community and hospital. Community cases were older than hospitalized cases (median age, 4.4 versus 1.7 years, respectively; P < .01), and a minority of community cases (26.5%) sought medical attention. Among the hospitalized children with HCoV detected, 39 (18.4%) received respiratory support and 24 (11.3%) were admitted to the pediatric intensive care unit (PICU). Age <2 years (odds ratio [OR] = 5.0; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.9–13.1) and cardiovascular (OR = 3.9; 95% CI, 1.6–9.5), genetic/congenital (OR = 2.8; 95% CI, 1.1–7.0), and respiratory chronic complex conditions ([CCCs] OR = 4.5; 95% CI, 1.7–12.0) were associated with receiving respiratory support. Genetic/congenital (OR = 2.8; 95% CI, 1.1–7.4) CCCs were associated with PICU admission. Severity of illness was similar among hospitalized children with different HCoV types.

Its effects may accompany stroke care for a long time. We compared the treatment, short-term and long-term functional outcomes of patients with AIS from 2019 to 2020. Our objective was to evaluate the effect of COVID-19 epidemic on mechanical thrombectomy (MT) in patients in our hospital. METHODS: We collected information on subjects treated with MT in 2019–2020, including age, sex, time from the onset to arterial sheath insertion, time from the onset to recanalization, the rate of lung infection and hemorrhagic transformation, modified Rankin scale (mRS), NHISS, and ASPECTS. RESULTS: The number of patients with MT decreased significantly by 26.6% in 2020 (p = 0.025). The pretreatment ASPECTS score for 2020 was significantly higher than 2019 (p = 0.004). Besides, the patients were more likely to develop lung infection (65 vs. 54.1%, p = 0.042) and had a higher risk of hemorrhagic transformation (47.4% vs. 30.4%, p = 0.005) in 2019. The discharged mRS reflected the worse short-term functional prognosis of patients with MT in 2019 (66 vs. 44.9%, p = 0.046). In the subgroup analysis of bridging thrombolysis (BT), more patients with BT are expected to have a poor short-term functional prognosis in 2020, according to the discharged mRS (62.5 vs. 37.5%, p = 0.024). However, there was no difference in mRS at 180 days between the two groups (p = 0.094). CONCLUSION: For patients with MT, both short- and long-term functional outcomes were not significantly affected due to the mild condition of patients admitted to hospital in 2020. For patients with BT, the COVID-19 pandemic has prolonged the green channel time of stroke, leading to a poor short-term functional prognosis of patients with stroke in the pandemic period.

RESULTS: While total ED patient volume decreased substantially, the number of ED overdose patients increased between March 6 and June 25, 2020. Furthermore, during this same period, coroner data revealed an increase in overdose deaths. CONCLUSION AND SCIENTIFIC SIGNIFICANCE: This preliminary evidence provides a key insight into the impact of COVID‐19 on both overdose presentations to the ED and county overdose deaths.

The reaction accommodated a range of substitutions to form 2,2- and 3,3-disubstituted pyrrolidines and spiropyrrolidines with high enantioselectivities. The importance of the thioester activating group was demonstrated by comparison to ketone and oxoester-containing substrates. DFT studies supported the aza-Michael cyclization as the rate- and stereochemistry-determining step and correctly predicted the formation of the major enantiomer. The catalytic asymmetric syntheses of N-methylpyrrolidine alkaloids (R)-irnidine and (R)-bgugaine, which possess DNA binding and antibacterial properties, were achieved using the ""clip-cycle"" methodology.",2020-09-29,"Maddocks, Christopher J; Ermanis, Kristaps; Clarke, Paul A",Organic letters,,,,,,https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.orglett.0c03090; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32991808/,222160103.0

DESIGN: Multicentre prospective observational study of mechanically ventilated ward patients. Modified Poisson regression was used to assess association between nurse to patient ratio (NPR) and 90-day mortality, adjusted for designated medical team, Society of Critical Care Medicine (SCCM) triage priority and centre effect. NPR was divided into low (1:9.6 to 1:10), medium (1:6 to 1:8) and high (1:2.6). Sensitivity analysis was conducted for pneumonia with or without acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) to assess magnitude of association. SETTING: 7 acute public hospitals in Hong Kong. PARTICIPANTS: All 485 mechanically ventilated patients in wards from participating hospitals between 18 January 2016 and 17 April 2016 were recruited. Three hundred patients were included after excluding patients with limitation of therapy within 24 hours of intubation. MAIN OUTCOMES: 90-day mortality, Mortality Prediction Model III Standardised mortality ratio (MPMIII(0) SMR). RESULTS: 201 patients died within 90 days after intubation (67.0%, 95% CI 61.5% to 72.1%), with MPMIII(0) SMR 1.88, 95% CI 1.63 to 2.17. Compared with high NPR, medium and low NPRs were associated with higher risk of 90-day mortality (adjusted relative risk (RR(adj)) 1.84, 95% CI 1.70 to 1.99 and 1.64, 95% CI 1.47 to 1.83, respectively). For 114 patients with pneumonia with or without ARDS, low to medium NPR, too sick to benefit from ICU (SCCM priority 4b), no ICU consultation and designated medical team were associated with risk of 90-day mortality (RR(adj) 1.49, 95% CI 1.40 to 1.58; RR(adj) 1.60, 95% CI 1.49 to 1.72; RR(adj) 1.34, 95% CI 1.27 to 1.40; RR(adj) 0.85, 95% CI 0.78 to 0.93, respectively).

This retrospective analysis reports changing trends in the demographics and clinical outcomes of hospitalized US COVID-19 patients between April and August 2020. Design and methods: The Premier Healthcare Database Special Release was used to examine patient demographics of hospitalized COVID-19 patients from all US Census Bureau divisions. Demographics included age, sex, race, and ethnicity. Clinical outcomes included in-hospital mortality, intensive care unit (ICU) admission, and receipt of invasive mechanical ventilation. Results: Overall, 146,491 hospitalized COVID-19 patients were included (mean [SD] age, 61.0 [18.4] years; 51.7% male; 29.6% White non-Hispanic). Monthly total hospitalizations decreased from 44,854 in April to 18,533 in August; ICU admissions increased from 19.8% to 23.6%, and ventilator use and inpatient mortality decreased from 18.6% to 14.5% and 21.0% to 11.4%, respectively.

Airborne transmission via droplets and aerosol has been recently recognized as one of the infection modes for the SARS-CoV-2 virus. Hospitals have deployed/incorporated indoor air purifiers with the hope to minimize the transmission risk of SARS-CoV-2 virus. Nevertheless, the effectiveness of the indoor air purifier in reducing the transmission risk remained unknown. This study uses computational fluid dynamics to model the dispersion of the aerosol particles exhaled from the patient under the influence of an air conditioner, exhaust fans and air purifier. The numerical model showed that airflow from the diffusers, exhaust fans and placement of the air purifier significantly influenced the dispersion pattern of the aerosol particles in the common ward. Multiple air purifiers placed at 1 meter above the floor and next to a patient can increase the total efficiency from 37.14 to 59.91% for weak exhalation and from 36.44% to 48.81% for medium exhalation. No aerosol particles flew out from the door for weak and medium exhalation when multiple air purifiers were deployed in the common ward. Location and matching the clean air delivery rate with the size of the room are the important factors that affect the performance of the air purifier. © The Author(s).",2022,"Saw, L. H.; Leo, B.

The purpose of this study was to investigate whether a commercially available sterile surgical helmet system (SSHS) can be considered protective against COVID-19 and therefore safe for use. METHODS: A double-blinded randomized controlled study was performed to investigate the efficacy of the ViVi® SSHS with a high-efficiency particulate air filter called HFD Hood (THI, Total Healthcare Innovation GmbH, Feistritz im Rosental, Austria) to protect against respiratory droplets. Forty recruited participants were divided into two different groups. The SSHS was tested using a validated qualitative test for respirator masks through saccharin or placebo solutions based on random allocation into two cohorts. Saccharin droplets are a validated surrogated marker for any elements of viral size, such as coronaviruses. A positive report of sweet taste after saccharin exposure was suggestive of ViVi® SSHS inefficacy in protection against droplets. RESULTS: One participant out of 21 (4.8%) reported positive for taste within the placebo cohort, while five out of 19 (26.3%) reported positive for taste within the saccharin cohort upon testing. Two out of 21 (9.5%) participants reported positive for taste within the placebo cohort, and two out of 19 (10.5%) reported positive for taste within the saccharin cohort upon retesting. There were no statistically significant differences between the saccharin and placebo groups in either the test or retest measurements (p = 0.085 and p = 1.000, respectively).

The pandemic reached the Israeli occupied West Bank of Palestine in early March 2020, and lockdown immediately ensued. OBJECTIVES: To assess the prevalence and predictors of distress and insecurity among Birzeit University’s community during the COVID-19 pandemic and lockdown. METHODS: An online survey completed in March-April 2020 using standardized and previously validated distress and insecurity scales. The survey was placed on the University portal accessed by students, faculty and employees, and was sent by email to faculty and employees. Data were weighted to reflect the University community’s distribution. FINDINGS: There were 1,851 participants in the study: 84% were undergraduate students, 10% graduate students, and 6% faculty and employees. Sixty two percent were women. Ages ranged from 17 to 70 years (mean 24 ± 9.7). Prevalence of moderate/high distress and insecurity were 40% and 48% respectively. Multiple logistic regression revealed that women, those under 35 years old and those with worse reported income, had significantly higher odds of distress and insecurity compared to their counterparts. Undergraduate students or living with a person at home with high risk of illness with COVID-19 were associated with higher odds of distress compared to their counterparts (OR = 1.56, 95%CI[1.13–2.15]) and (OR = 1.34, 95%CI[1.11–1.62]) respectively.

The communication management of the H1N1 pandemic, an international news event with local implications, by the Singapore government is a rich locus for understanding the dynamics of public relations, health communication, and journalism. A content analysis shows that the evolution of information from press release to news is marked by significant changes in media frames, including the expansion and diversification in dominant frames and emotion appeals, stronger thematic framing, more sources of information, conversion of loss frames into gain frames, and amplification of positive tone favoring the public health agency's position.

We used the hospital anxiety and depression scale for anxiety and depression screening, and the insomnia severity index to assess sleep disturbances. RESULTS: our study revealed a high prevalence of anxiety and depressive symptoms, and insomnia (70.9%, 71.1% and 60.6% respectively). Multivariable statistics showed that anxiety symptoms were correlated to female gender (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 1.784, 95% confidence interval (CI 1.252-2.542; p=10(-3)), history of mental illness (aOR: 1.680, 95% CI: 1.329-2.125; p<10(-3)), frequently social media exposure (aOR: 1.578, 95%CI: 1.250-1.992; p<10(-3)), times to focus on COVID-19 ≥ 3hours (aOR: 1.840, 95% CI: 1.433-2.362; p<10(-3)), consultation with doctor in the clinic in the past 14 days (aOR: 1.821, 95%CI : 1.220-2.718; p=0.003) and recent traumatic event in the past 14 days (aOR: 1.641,95% CI: 1.331-2.024; p<10(-3)).

Insight in pathways associated with unfavourable outcome may lead to new treatment strategies. METHODS: We performed a prospective cohort study of patients with COVID-19 admitted to general ward or ICU who underwent serial blood sampling. To provide insight in the pathways involved in disease progression, associations were estimated between outcome risk and serial measurements of 64 biomarkers in potential important pathways of COVID-19 infection (inflammation, tissue damage, complement system, coagulation and fibrinolysis) using joint models combining Cox regression and linear mixed-effects models. For patients admitted to the general ward, the primary outcome was admission to the ICU or mortality (unfavourable outcome). For patients admitted to the ICU, the primary outcome was 12-week mortality. FINDINGS: A total of 219 patients were included: 136 (62%) on the ward and 119 patients (54%) on the ICU; 36 patients (26%) were included in both cohorts because they were transferred from general ward to ICU. On the general ward, 54 of 136 patients (40%) had an unfavourable outcome and 31 (23%) patients died. On the ICU, 54 out of 119 patients (45%) died. Unfavourable outcome on the general ward was associated with changes in concentrations of IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, soluble Receptor for Advanced Glycation End Products (sRAGE), vascular cell adhesion molecule 1 (VCAM-1) and Pentraxin-3. Death on the ICU was associated with changes in IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, sRAGE, VCAM-1, Pentraxin-3, urokinase-type plasminogen activator receptor, IL-1-receptor antagonist, CD14, procalcitonin, tumor necrosis factor alfa, tissue factor, complement component 5a, Growth arrest-specific 6, angiopoietin 2, and lactoferrin. Pathway analysis showed that unfavourable outcome on the ward was mainly driven by chemotaxis and interleukin production, whereas death on ICU was associated with a variety of pathways including chemotaxis, cell-cell adhesion, innate host response mechanisms, including the complement system, viral life cycle regulation, angiogenesis, wound healing and response to corticosteroids. INTERPRETATION: Clinical deterioration in patients with severe COVID-19 involves multiple pathways, including chemotaxis and interleukin production, but also endothelial dysfunction, the complement system, and immunothrombosis. Prognostic markers showed considerable overlap between general ward and ICU patients, but we identified distinct differences between groups that should be considered in the development and timing of interventional therapies in COVID-19.

Plastics in terms of personal protective equipment (PPEs) and other single-use medical equipment along with packaging solutions owing to their inherent properties have emerged as a life-savior for protecting the health and safety of the frontline health workers and the common citizens during the pandemic. However, plastics have been deemed as evil polluter due to their indiscriminate littering and mismanagement amid increased plastic usage and waste generation during this unprecedented crisis. This article reviews and assesses to dwell upon whether plastics in the time of pandemic are acting as protector of the public health or polluter of the environment. Considering the utilities and limitations of plastic along with its management or mismanagement, and the fate, an equitable appraisal suggests that the consumers' irresponsible behavior, and attitude and poor awareness, and the stress on waste management infrastructure in terms of collection, operation, and financial constraints as the major drivers, leading to mismanagement, turn plastic into an evil polluter of the environment. Plastic can be a protector if managed properly and complemented by the circular economy strategies in terms of reduction, recycle and recovery, and thereby preventing leakage into the environment. To safeguard the supply chain of PPEs, several decontamination techniques have been adopted worldwide ensuring their effective reprocessing to prioritize the circular economy within the system. Policy guidelines encouraging to adopt safer practices and sustainable technical solutions along with consumers' education for awareness creation are the need of the hour for preventing plastic to turn from protector with high utility to polluter.",2021,"Parashar, Neha; Hait, Subrata",Sci Total Environ,,#968606,,,,,228076759.0

Consequently, the development and validation of simple and low-cost methods are essential for a rapid CML diagnosis in less specialized and equipped centers. In this study, we develop and demonstrate an accessible, rapid, and low-cost method using RT-LAMP for BCR-ABL1 detection in both cell lines and CML clinical samples, using fluorescent and colorimetric assays. Both methods demonstrated diagnostic specificity of 100% and while diagnostic sensitivity reaches more than 90% in samples with RT-qPCR cycle threshold above 31. The obtained data indicates that the proposed method here described is a cheaper, robust and specific approach for CML diagnosis with outstanding performance, especially for CML diagnostic procedure where present high BCR-ABL1 expression.",2021-12-28,"Aoki, Mateus Nóbrega; Marin, Anelis Maria; Zanette, Dalila Luciola; Nardin, Jeanine Marie; Munhoz, Eduardo Cilião; Blanes, Lucas; Boçon de Araújo Munhoz, Francielle; de Oliveira Coelho, Bruna",Analytical biochemistry,,,,,,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ab.2021.114541; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34971572/,245575615.0

Material and methods: From 4 March to 15 July 2020 a total of 11 children meeting KD criteria were hospitalised in the Department of Infectious Diseases and Paediatrics, S. Zeromski Specialist Hospital in Krakow and the Clinic of Children's Diseases, Department of Paediatrics, Jagiellonian University Medical College in Krakow. This paper analyses the data collected and describes in detail the disease in 2 children with PIMS-TS. Results: None of the 11 children who met the criteria of KD had a positive SARS-CoV-2 PCR test on admission. SARS-CoV-2 IgG test results were positive in 2 patients. All children presented with fever, rash, and conjunctivitis;9 with swollen hands and feet;8 with mucous membrane changes;5 with abdominal symptoms;5 with respiratory symptoms;and 1 with neurological signs. As regards laboratory tests, C-reactive protein (CRP), procalcitonin, lymphocytes, platelets, All were assessed in all patients, albumin in 10/11, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), fibrinogen in 9/11, troponin and ferritin in 6/11, pro-BNP, D-dimers in 8/11. Echocardiography was performed in all patients and showed coronary artery abnormalities in 4 children. In PIMS-TS significant elevation of procalcitonin, CRP, D-dimers, N-terminal prohormone of brain natriuretic peptide (NT-pro-BNP), and thrombocytopaenia were observed. Conclusions: 1. Because of the asymptomatic course of SARS-CoV-2 infection in children who subsequently developed PIMS-TS and the absence of any viral genetic material in a sample collected from the upper airways upon PIMS-TS diagnosis, a detailed epidemiological interview and a reliable serology testing for SARS-CoV-2 infection are necessary in each case meeting KD or PIMS-TS criteria. 2.

As one major gastropod lineage, the patellogastropods show different characters in its shell field morphogenesis compared to other gastropods (e.g., the pulmonate gastropod Lymnaea stagnalis), likely related to its epibolic gastrulation. The investigation on the shell field morphogenesis of patellogastropods would be useful to reveal the lineage-specific characters in the process and explore the deep conservation among different molluscan lineages. RESULTS: We investigated the early shell field morphogenesis in the patellogastropod Lottia goshimai using multiple techniques. Electron microscopy revealed distinct morphological characters for the central and peripheral cells of the characteristic rosette-like shell field. Gene expression analysis and F-actin staining suggested that the shell field morphogenesis in this species predominantly relied on cell movement and F-actin dynamics, while BrdU assay revealed that cell proliferation contributed little to the process. We found constant contacts between ectodermal and meso/endodermal tissues during the early stages of shell field morphogenesis, which did not support the induction of shell field by endodermal tissues in general, but a potential stage-specific induction was indicated. CONCLUSIONS: Our results emphasize the roles of cell movement and F-actin dynamics during the morphogenesis of the shell field in Lo. goshimai, and suggest potential regulators such as diffusible factors and F-actin modulators. These findings reflect the differences in shell field morphogenesis of different gastropods, and add to the knowledge of molluscan larval shell formation.",2020,"Yang, Weihong; Huan, Pin; Liu, Baozhong",BMC Dev Biol,,#32814562,,,,,221167319.0

In addition to the fullength human enzyme of 882 amino acids, here designated NDST1A, a shorter form containing 825 amino acids (NDST1B) is synthesized after alternative splicing of the NDST1 mRNA. NDST1B is mostly expressed at a low level, but increased amounts are seen in several types of cancer where it is associated with shorter survival. In this study we aimed at characterizing the enzymatic properties of NDST1B and its effect on HS biosynthesis. Purified recombinant NDST1B lacked both N-deacetylase and N-sulfotransferase activities. Interestingly, HEK293 cells overexpressing NDST1B synthesized HS with reduced sulfation and altered domain structure. FRET-microscopy demonstrated that both NDST1A and NDST1B had the capacity to interact with the HS co-polymerase subunits EXT1 and EXT2 and also to form NDST1A/NDST1B dimers. Since lysates from cells overexpressing NDST1B contained less NDST enzyme activity than control cells, we suggest that NDST1B works in a dominant negative manner, tentatively by replacing the active endogenous NDST1 in the enzyme complexes taking part in biosynthesis.",2022,"Missaghian, Parisa; Dierker, Tabea; Khosrowabadi, Elham; Axling, Fredrik; Eriksson, Inger; Ghanem, Abdurrahman; Kusche-Gullberg, Marion; Kellokumpu, Sakari; Kjellén, Lena",Glycobiology,,#mdl-35137078,,,,https://doi.org/10.1093/glycob/cwac004; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/35137078/,246677674.0

The pollution level of six organophosphorus pesticides, three herbicides, and one bactericide in groundwater and the Wenyu River, and their fates in three sewage treatment plants (STPs) and a hospital were investigated in this study. The concentrations of the ten detected pesticides ranged from not detected (ND) to 323.44 ng L-1 in different water samples from Beijing; metalaxyl was detected to have the highest concentration (89.58 ng L-1), and the detection frequencies of atrazine and metalaxyl were 100%. The maximum concentrations of pesticides in the Wenyu River, STPs, and the hospital were 1-2 orders of magnitude higher than those in the groundwater. Good removal efficiencies by the treatment processes were observed for ametryn (100%), while the removal efficiencies for atrazine and omethoate were the lowest in the three STPs (- 9.6% and 12.67%, respectively). Finally, risk quotient (RQ) values of each contaminant were estimated from the maximum values determined for typical urban to assess the ecology and health effects. In the case of environmental toxicity, the highest RQ values (> 1) were obtained for dichlorvos and omethoate.

The METD refers to the least amount of training required to elicit meaningful increases in 1RM strength. A series of five studies utilising mixed methods, were conducted using PL athletes & coaches of all levels in an attempt to better understand the METD for 1RM strength. The studies of this multi-experiment paper are: an interview study with elite PL athletes and highly experienced PL coaches (n = 28), an interview and survey study with PL coaches and PL athletes of all levels (n = 137), two training intervention studies with intermediate-advanced PL athletes (n = 25) and a survey study with competitive PL athletes of different levels (n = 57). PL athletes looking to train with a METD approach can do so by performing ~3–6 working sets of 1–5 repetitions each week, with these sets spread across 1–3 sessions per week per powerlift, using loads above 80% 1RM at a Rate of Perceived Exertion (RPE) of 7.5–9.5 for 6–12 weeks and expect to gain strength. PL athletes who wish to further minimize their time spent training can perform autoregulated single repetition sets at an RPE of 9–9.5 though they should expect that strength gains will be less likely to be meaningful. However, the addition of 2–3 back-off sets at ~80% of the single repetitions load, may produce greater gains over 6 weeks while following a 2-3-1 squat-bench press-deadlift weekly training frequency.

We show that the kinetics of the neutralizing antibody response is typical of an acute viral infection, with declining neutralizing antibody titres observed after an initial peak, and that the magnitude of this peak is dependent on disease severity. Although some individuals with high peak infective dose (ID50 > 10,000) maintained neutralizing antibody titres >1,000 at >60 d POS, some with lower peak ID50 had neutralizing antibody titres approaching baseline within the follow-up period.

The American Heart Association has reduced target door-to-needle (DTN) times from 60 to 45 min in the hopes of continued process improvements across institutions. OBJECTIVE To start a quality improvement project called CODE FAST in order to reduce DTN times at our institution. MATERIALS AND METHODS We retrospectively reviewed data from our internally maintained database of patients treated with intravenous tPA before and after implementation of the CODE FAST protocol. We assessed demographic information, time of day and times of arrival to first image and delivery of tPA in patients from February 2014 to February 2015. Outcomes were assessed based on discharge to home. Univariate analysis was performed to assess for improvement in DTN times before and after implementation of the protocol. RESULTS A total of 93 patients (41 pre-CODE FAST and 52 post-CODE FAST) received IV tPA during the study period. Patients were equally matched between the two groups except that in the pre-CODE FAST era patients receiving tPA were younger and more likely to be men. There was a substantial reduction in door-to-imaging time from a median of 16 to 8 min (p<0.0001) and DTN time with a reduction in the median from 62 to 25 min (p<0.0001). In logistic regression modeling, there was a trend towards more discharges to home in patients treated during the CODE FAST era. CONCLUSIONS We present a quality improvement project that has been overwhelmingly successful in reducing DTN time to <30 min.

Design/methodology/approach: A total of 186 private university students was enrolled in this cross-sectional study using a combination of snowball and purposive sampling approaches. Anthropometric measurements, including body height, body weight before and during the MCO enforcement were self-reported by the respondents. Screen-time based sedentary behaviour sedentary behaviour was evaluated using HELENA sedentary behaviour questionnaire, whereas the Self-Regulation of Eating Behaviour Questionnaire (SREBQ) was used to determine the eating self-regulatory skills in MCO. Findings: Respondents spent most of the time on the internet for non-study purposes (148 ± 77.7 min). It is also noted that 64.5% of the respondents had medium eating self-regulatory skill during the MCO, with an average score of 3.0 ± 0.5. Findings from path analysis confirmed that poor eating self-regulation significantly contributed to the weight gain during home confinement (ß = −0.24, p = 0.01). In conclusion, eating self-regulation, but not total screen time, emerged as the determinant for weight gain during the COVID-19 lockdown.

To address the logic of this 3-cm cutoff beyond small single-center experiences, we stratified patients by 1-cm tumor size intervals and hypothesized that disease-specific survival (DSS) would not vary significantly between adjacent groups. METHODS Patients treated with local ablation for T1 HCC (≤8 cm) were identified from the surveillance, epidemiology, and end results database (2004-2008). Log-rank tests and multivariable Cox proportional hazards models were used to compare DSS curves of adjacent study groups. RESULTS There were 1,083 patients included in the study (26 % female, median age: 62 years). The 3-year DSS was significantly lower in patients with 3- to 4-cm tumors compared to 2- to 3-cm tumors (58 vs. 72 %, p = 0.002). In adjusted models, DSS did not vary significantly between any size intervals up to 3 cm. Patients with 3- to 4-cm tumors, however, had a poorer prognosis compared with patients with 2- to 3-cm tumors (hazard ratio: 1.6, 95 % confidence interval: 1.18-2.18, p = 0.002). DSS also fell when tumor size increased from 5-6 to 6-7 cm (53 vs. 21 %, 0.006). CONCLUSIONS This study emphasizes the 3-cm size, and possibly the 6-cm size, as informative predictive thresholds when ablating HCC, because variability of DSS occurred specifically at these tumor sizes.

The study's inclusion criteria were that only those medical staff of different hospitals was approached to collect data performed inwards isolated for Covid-19 treatment corona isolation wards. Maslach burnout inventory (MBI-HSS) and willingness to work (WTW) tools were used to collect data. Descriptive and Partial least square analysis was utilized to evaluate the relationships. The Coefficient of determination or R-Square value was 0.299, which means 29.9% or 30% of the work burnout variation was due to the impact of emotional exhaustion and personal accomplishment. Perceived danger, Role Competence, Self-Efficacy, and Sense of duty significantly impacted the willingness to work. Despite the workload and perceived risk, 42.6% of participants agreed to work if their department had to need their services, while 55.2% of participants agreed to work whether their department asked them or not.

Here we present for the first time that SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus and GX_P2V could infect lung progenitor and even anterior foregut endoderm cells causing these cells death, which differentiated from human embryonic stem cells (hESCs). The infection and replication of SARS-CoV-2 and GX_P2V were inhibited when treated with whey protein of breastmilk and Remdesivir, confirming that these two viruses could infect lung progenitor and even anterior foregut endoderm. Moreover, we found that SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus could infect endoderm and ectoderm. We found that whey protein blocked SARS-CoV-2 infecting these cells. In line with the SARS-CoV-2 results, GX_P2V could also infected endoderm and ectoderm, and also was inhibited by Remdesivir treatment. Although expressing coronavirus related receptor such as ACE2 and TMPRSS2, mesoderm cells are not permissive for SARS-CoV-2 and GX_P2V infection, which needed further to study the mechanisms. Interestingly, we also found that hESCs, which also express ACE2 and TMPRSS2 markers, are permissive for GX_P2V but not SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus infection and replication, indicating the widespread cell types for GX_P2V infection. Heparin treatment blocked efficiently viral infection. These results provided insight that these stem cells maybe provided a stable repository of coronavirus function or genome.

The objective of this transdiagnostic analysis was to examine the effect of benzodiazepines on treatment outcomes in older patients with generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) or major depressive disorder (MDD). METHODS Secondary analyses of data from 2 clinical trials of antidepressant pharmacotherapy for GAD (escitalopram vs placebo, 2006-2009) or MDD (open treatment with venlafaxine, 2009-2014) were conducted. Participants included 640 adults aged 60+ years with DSM-IV-defined GAD (n = 177) or MDD (n = 463). Benzodiazepine data were collected at baseline. Adherence and treatment response were assessed over 12 weeks. The analysis addressed whether coprescribed benzodiazepines are associated with treatment response, antidepressant medication adherence, dropout, final dose of antidepressant medication, and report of antidepressant-related adverse effects. RESULTS Participants with GAD and coprescribed benzodiazepines were treated with a lower mean dosage of escitalopram and were less likely to complete the trial; there was no difference in adherence or treatment response. Participants with MDD and coprescribed benzodiazepines were less likely to tolerate a therapeutic dose of venlafaxine and reported more medication-related adverse effects; there was no difference in adherence, dropout, or treatment response. CONCLUSIONS Coprescription of benzodiazepines was associated with increased dropout in older patients with GAD and more medication-related adverse effects in older patients with MDD. However, with the systematic clinical attention offered in a clinical trial, they do not impede treatment response. Clinicians should be aware that a coprescribed benzodiazepine may be a marker of a more challenging treatment course.

Indonesia is one of the countries that have a high rate of COVID-19 incidences which naturally has led to various policies intended to suppress further transmission by limiting social mobility. During this pandemic people are faced with uncertain conditions that result in an increasing level of boredom, fear and even public anxiety. The author was interested in exploring the realities of the COVID-19 pandemic by examining the possible relationship between public anxiety during the COVID-19 pandemic and an awareness of the need for spirituality which may be achieved by means of performing a Javanese spiritual practice called tapa brata. This practice was then examined in relation to public anxiety that occurred during the COVID-19 pandemic. Our analysis has generated several main results. Firstly anxiety among the people during the pandemic is caused by a common awareness of the uncertain and constantly changing reality. Secondly tapa brata is a mental practice of forming a calmer and wiser self which can adapt to all changes. Thirdly tapa brata is an esoteric personal practice that can overcome public anxiety during a pandemic and has a positive physiological effect on people's immunity during the COVID-19 pandemic.

However, such measures may increase the risk of loneliness. The current study aimed to investigate (a) whether social distancing measures, particularly limiting close social interactions, are associated with loneliness among older adults, and (b) whether the association between social distancing measures and loneliness is moderated by sociodemographic characteristics. METHOD: Data were from the fourth wave (April 29 to May 26, 2020) of the nationally representative Understanding America Study COVID-19 Survey. We used data on adults 50 years or older (N = 3,253). Logistic regression models of loneliness were performed. Five indicators of social distancing measures were considered: (a) avoiding public spaces, gatherings, or crowds; (b) canceling or postponing social activities; (c) social visits; (d) no close contact (within 6 feet) with people living together; and (e) with people not living together. RESULTS: Cancelling or postponing social activities and avoiding close contact with people living together were associated with 33% (odds ratio [OR] = 1.33, confidence interval [CI] = 1.06−1.68, p < .05) and 47% (OR = 1.47, CI = 1.09−1.99, p < .05) greater odds of loneliness, respectively. Furthermore, limiting close contact with coresidents increased the probability of loneliness more for males, non-Hispanic Whites, and those with higher levels of education and income. DISCUSSION: Efforts should be made to help older adults maintain social connectedness with close others by virtual communication methods.

The purpose of this study was to investigate the outcomes of RAMIE using the microanatomy-based concept in the initial introduction phase. METHODS: We have performed more than 500 TEPP procedures as minimally invasive esophagectomy (MIE). After performing about 400 cases of MIE, we established a microanatomy-based standardization of UMLND. In October 2018, we introduced RAMIE, and have performed 75 procedures in 20 months. Two groups were analyzed: a group after microanatomy-based standardization in TEPP (100 cases after completing 400 cases of TEPP) and a RAMIE group (75 cases). Finally, 51 paired cases were matched using a propensity score. Furthermore, the change in postoperative short-term outcome for RAMIE in the initial introduction phase was analyzed. RESULTS: Although there were no significant differences between the two groups in the number of upper mediastinal lymph nodes dissected, there was a significant decrease (P = 0.036) in intraoperative blood loss volume with RAMIE, representing a definite benefit for patients. The thoracoscopic operative time for RAMIE decreased by almost 100 min following less than 50 cases of experience, reaching the same level as that for recent TEPP, but with only one-tenth the operator experience.

METHODS: Subjects with asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic mCRPC were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive either atezolizumab followed by sipuleucel-T (Arm 1) or sipuleucel-T followed by atezolizumab (Arm 2). The primary endpoint was safety, while secondary endpoints included preliminary clinical activity such as objective tumor response and systemic immune responses that could identify key molecular and immunological changes associated with sequential administration of atezolizumab and sipuleucel-T. RESULTS: A total of 37 subjects were enrolled. The median age was 75.0 years, median prostate specific antigen (PSA) was 21.9 ng/mL, and subjects had a median number of three prior treatments. Most subjects (83.8%) had at least one treatment-related adverse event. There were no grade 4 or 5 toxicities attributed to either study drug. Immune-related adverse events and infusion reactions occurred in 13.5% of subjects, and all of which were grade 1 or 2. Of 23 subjects with Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors measurable disease, only one subject in Arm 2 had a partial response (PR) and four subjects overall had stable disease (SD) at 6 months reflecting an objective response rate of 4.3% and a disease control rate of 21.7%.

We demonstrate that while CHIT1 and CHI3L1 display similar temporal expression dynamics in both groups, profound between-group differences were noted for these targets at later time-points i.e., when cells were fully differentiated. CHIT1 and CHI3L1 expression were significantly higher in MoMas from ALS patients at both the transcriptomic and protein level, with CHI3L1 levels also being influenced by age. Conversely, CHI3L2 expression was not influenced by disease state, culture duration, or age.

Selection of patients for use of Tocilizumab was based on severity of disease, rapid clinical deterioration, presence of CRS and absence of any absolute contraindication to Tocilizumab. Improvement after Tocilizumab was defined as improvement in oxygen requirement and inflammatory parameters. Serum levels of inflammatory cytokines like C-reactive protein, ferritin, D-dimer and lactate dehydrogenase levels were monitored before and after administering Tocilizumab.

2efa1bdj,,WHO,The Vaccine Supply Chain: A Call for Resilience Analytics to Support COVID-19 Vaccine Production and Distribution,,,,unk,"The COVID19 pandemic has highlighted the lack of resilience in supply chains, as global networks fail from disruptions at single nodes and connections. Through an overview of the existing vaccine and pharmaceutical supply chain publications focusing on resilience, as well as recent papers reporting modeling of resilience in supply chains across multiple fields, we find that models for supply chain resilience are few and most of them are focused on individual dimensions of resilience rather than on comprehensive strategy necessary for scaling up vaccine production and distribution in emergency settings. We find that COVID19 resulted in a wave of interest to supply chain resilience, but publications from 2020 are narrow in focus and largely qualitative in nature;evidence-based models and measures are rare. Further, publications often focus exclusively on specific portions of the specific supply chain of interest, excluding associated supporting networks, such as transportation, social and command and control (C2) necessary for vaccine production and equitable distribution. This lack of network analysis is a major gap in the literature that needs to be bridged in order to create methods of real-time analysis and decision tools for the COVID19 vaccine supply chain. We conclude that a comprehensive, quantitative approach to network resilience that encompasses the supply chain in the context of other social and physical networks is needed in order to address the emerging challenges of a large-scale COVID-19 vaccination program.

Continuing the neurosurgical training while maintaining the well-being of our residents should be the primary concern of leaders of training programs. OBJECTIVES: The aim of this cross-sectional study was the evaluation of the impact of COVID-19 on neurosurgical residency programs and neurosurgical practice in five tertiary medical centers in our country. We also aimed at detecting the shortcomings in training programs and provide solutions. METHODS: An online questionnaire-based survey was prepared and sent to 73 neurosurgery residents in 5 tertiary centers in 4 governorates by social networks. The questions focused on the evaluation of clinical and surgical activities before and after the pandemic. Safety precautions, education, and residents’ mental health were also evaluated. RESULTS: Fifty residents responded to our survey. We identified a significant reduction in surgical cases, inpatient services, and working hours per week during the pandemic comparing to the pre-pandemic era. We also identified a significant increase in research hours and changes in educational methods from in-person methods to virtual ones. Seventy-four percent reported that personal protective equipment was not adequate for their duties. Sixty-eight percent experienced burnout symptoms. Unavailability of personal protective equipment, negative concerns regarding the surgical career, and financial strains significantly affected the mental health of residents. CONCLUSIONS: The survey highlighted the negative impact of COVID-19 on neurosurgical practice and education. Being in a developing country, this negative effect was amplified due to financial reasons and weak infrastructure. Inadequate personal protective equipment increased the risk of infection and work-related stress among neurosurgery residents. We lacked telemedicine services in our country.

This study aimed to investigate level of immunity in communities within this population as well as infection exposure required to achieve herd immunity. Methods: Anti-SARS-CoV-2 seropositivity was assessed in ten CMW communities between June 21 and September 9, 2020. PCR positivity, infection positivity (antibody and/or PCR positive), and infection severity rate were also estimated. Associations with anti-SARS-CoV-2 positivity were investigated using regression analyses. Results: Study included 4,970 CMWs who were mostly men (95.0%) and <40 years of age (71.5%). Seropositivity ranged from 54.9% (95% CI: 50.2-59.4%) to 83.8% (95% CI: 79.1-87.7%) in the different CMW communities. Pooled mean seropositivity across all communities was 66.1% (95% CI: 61.5-70.6%). PCR positivity ranged from 0.0% to 10.5% (95% CI: 7.4-14.8%) in the different CMW communities. Pooled mean PCR positivity was 3.9% (95% CI: 1.6-6.9%). Median cycle threshold (Ct) value was 34.0 (range: 15.8-37.4). The majority (79.5%) of PCR-positive individuals had Ct value >30 indicative of earlier rather than recent infection. Infection positivity (antibody and/or PCR positive) ranged from 62.5% (95% CI: 58.3-66.7%) to 83.8% (95% CI: 79.1-87.7%) in the different CMW communities. Pooled mean infection positivity was 69.5% (95% CI: 62.8-75.9%). Only five infections were ever severe and one was ever critical, an infection severity rate of 0.2% (95% CI: 0.1-0.4%). Conclusions: Based on an extended range of epidemiological measures, active infection is rare in these communities with limited if any sustainable infection transmission for clusters to occur.

We hypothesized that therapeutic anticoagulation would improve outcomes in critically ill patients with Covid-19. Methods We conducted an open-label, adaptive, multiplatform, randomized, clinical trial. Patients with severe Covid-19, defined as the requirement for organ support with high flow nasal cannula, non-invasive ventilation, invasive ventilation, vasopressors, or inotropes, were randomized to receive therapeutic anticoagulation with heparin or pharmacological thromboprophylaxis as per local usual care. The primary outcome was an ordinal scale combining in-hospital mortality (assigned -1) and days free of organ support to day 21. Results Therapeutic anticoagulation met the pre-defined criteria for futility in patients with severe Covid-19. The primary outcome was available for 1,074 participants (529 randomized to therapeutic anticoagulation and 545 randomized to usual care pharmacological thromboprophylaxis). Median organ support-free days were 3 days (interquartile range -1, 16) in patients assigned to therapeutic anticoagulation and 5 days (interquartile range -1, 16) in patients assigned to usual care pharmacological thromboprophylaxis (adjusted odds ratio 0.87, 95% credible interval (CrI) 0.70-1.08, posterior probability of futility [odds ratio<1.2] 99.8%).

METHODS: Three locations were selected, at the scale of province, municipality and barangay (i.e. village). Data on disease incidence, programme activities, and programme management were collected on-site through meetings and focus group discussions. RESULTS: Adaptation of disease control strategies to the epidemiological situation per barangay, through micro-stratification, brings gains in efficiency, but should be accompanied by further capacity building on local situational analysis for better selection and targeting of vector control interventions within the barangay. An integrated approach to vector control, aiming to improve the rational use of resources, was evident with a multi-disease strategy for detection and response, and by the use of combinations of vector control methods. Collaboration within the health sector was apparent from the involvement of barangay health workers, re-orientation of job descriptions and the creation of a disease surveillance unit. The engagement of barangay leaders and use of existing community structures helped mobilize local resources and voluntary services for vector control. In one location, local authorities and the community were involved in the planning, implementation and evaluation of malaria control, which triggered local programme ownership. CONCLUSIONS: Strategies that contributed to an improved efficiency and sustainability of vector control operations were: micro-stratification, integration of vector control within the health sector, a multi-disease approach, involvement of local authorities, and empowerment of communities.

School-prepared meals are, on average, more nutritious than home-prepared meals. In the absence of recent data measuring changes in children's diets during the pandemic, this article aims to provide conservative, back-of-the-envelope estimates of the nutritional impacts of the pandemic for school-aged children in the United States. We used administrative data from the USDA on the number of NSLP lunches served in 2019 and 2020 and nationally representative data from the USDA School Nutrition and Meal Cost Study on the quality of school-prepared and home-prepared lunches. We estimate changes in lunchtime calories and nutrients consumed by NSLP participants from March to November 2020, compared to the same months in 2019. We estimate that an NSLP participant receiving no school meals would increase their caloric consumption by 640 calories per week and reduce their consumption of nutrients such as calcium and vitamin D. Because 27 to 78 million fewer lunches were served per week in March–November 2020 compared to the previous year, nationally, students may have consumed 3 to 10 billion additional calories per week.

The Adult Day Service (ADS) Plus intervention is delivered by trained staff at adult day service facilities to assist older adults with cognitive impairments and their family caregivers. Because sizable imbalances on important site characteristics might emerge from a simple randomization, we implemented a 3-stage constrained randomization approach to limit imbalance between intervention and usual care control conditions on 5 site characteristics: capacity; % of minority clients; % of clients with dementia; urban, rural or suburban location; and private or public ownership. In stage 1, the Balance Match Weighted (BMW) re-randomization procedure was used to assign 30 sites to ADS Plus or control arms based on the best randomization out of 20 total randomization for minimizing site imbalance. In stage 2, propensity scores from the BMW logistic regression analysis for reserve sites were used to determine substitutions for randomized sites that opted out of the CRT prior to implementation. In stage 3, a minimization approach was used to add 20 more sites to the trial. A standardized metric based on the half-normal distribution of the absolute value of mean differences was used to assess site imbalance. After stage 3, the remaining imbalance for the 49 enrolled sites was reduced by 75% from what would have been expected from a simple randomization.

This paper provides a thorough and transparent account of the development of a multi-method simulation model that emulates actual patient flow in the emergency department under COVID-19 pandemic conditions. Additionally, a number of performance measures useful to practitioners are introduced. A conceptual model was extracted from the main stakeholders at the case hospital through incremental elaboration and turned into a computational model. Two agent types were mainly modeled: patient and rooms. The simulated behavior of patient flow was validated with real-world data (Smart Crowding) and was able to replicate actual behavior in terms of patient occupancy.

Different clinical trials are still under way. Among them is Ivermectin (IVM), an FDA approved drug which was recently reported as a successful candidate to reduce SARS-CoV-2 viral load by inhibiting Importin-α1 (IMP-α1) protein which subsequently affects nuclear transport of viral proteins but its basic binding mode and inhibitory mechanism is unknown. Therefore, we aimed to explore the inhibitory mechanism and binding mode of IVM with IMP-α1 via different computational methods. Initially, comparative docking of IVM was performed against two different binding sites (Nuclear Localization Signal (NLS) major and minor sites) of IMP-α1 to predict the probable binding mode of IVM. Then, classical MD simulation was performed (IVM/NLS-Major site and IVM/NLS-Minor site), to predict its comparative stability dynamics and probable inhibitory mechanism. The stability dynamics and biophysical analysis of both sites highlighted the stable binding of IVM within NLS-Minor site by establishing and maintaining more hydrophobic contacts with crucial residues, required for IMP-α1 inhibition which were not observed in NLS-major site. Altogether, these results recommended the worth of IVM as a possible drug to limit the SARS-CoV-2 viral load and consequently reduces its progression. Communicated by Ramaswamy H.

One approach focuses on designing a novel variant of the human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) that binds more tightly to the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and diverts it from human cells. Here we formulate a novel protein design framework as a reinforcement learning problem. We generate new designs efficiently through the combination of a fast, biologically-grounded reward function and sequential action-space formulation. The use of Policy Gradients reduces the compute budget needed to reach consistent, high-quality designs by at least an order of magnitude compared to standard methods. Complexes designed by this method have been validated by molecular dynamics simulations, confirming their increased stability.

METHODS: We studied 2275 symptomatic and asymptomatic patients from Colombia with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and analyzed the associations between RT-PCR cycle threshold (Ct) value with gender, age, comorbidities, symptomatology, and disease severity. RESULTS: 15.4 % of the samples (n = 428) reported at least one comorbidity. There were 2011 symptomatic cases (72.4 %), being the most common reported symptom cough (57.2 %, n = 1586). Respiratory distress was present in 21.4 % of patients (n = 595), and 435 patients (15.6 %) required hospital admission. We observed that patients with no prior medical history harbored higher RNA copies than patients with comorbidities (p = 0.02). No significant differences in RNA copies were observed between symptomatic and asymptomatic patients (p = 0.82). Strong correlations were detected between Ct values and the presence of odynophagia (p = 0.03), diarrhea (p = 0.04), and headache (p = 0.0008). An inverse association was found between RNA copy number and markers of disease severity, namely, respiratory distress (P < 0.0001) and hospitalization requirement (P < 0.0001). CONCLUSIONS: SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR cycle thresholds reveal strong associations with a prior medical history, specific symptomatology, and disease severity markers. Further research controlling potential confounding variables needs to be conducted to evaluate the nature and usefulness of these associations in managing COVID-19 patients.

Studies of recent outbreaks of Zika virus in the Pacific, South America, Mexico and the Caribbean have associated the virus with severe neuropathology. Viral evolution may be one factor contributing to an apparent change in Zika disease as it spread from Southeast Asia across the Pacific to the Americas. To address this possibility, we have employed computational tools to compare the phylogeny, geography, immunology and RNA structure of Zika virus isolates from Africa, Asia, the Pacific and the Americas. In doing so, we compare and contrast methods and results for tree search and rooting of Zika virus phylogenies. In some phylogenetic analyses we find support for the hypothesis that there is a deep common ancestor between African and Asian clades (the ""Asia/Africa"" hypothesis). In other phylogenetic analyses, we find that Asian lineages are descendent from African lineages (the ""out of Africa"" hypothesis). In addition, we identify and evaluate key mutations in viral envelope protein coding and untranslated terminal RNA regions. We find stepwise mutations that have altered both immunological motif sets and regulatory sequence elements. Both of these sets of changes distinguish viruses found in Africa from those in the emergent Asia-Pacific-Americas lineage. These findings support the working hypothesis that mutations acquired by Zika virus in the Pacific and Americas contribute to changes in pathology.

This study aims to assess knowledge, attitudes and practices towards COVID-19 among Syrians in a post-conflict context. METHOD: A cross sectional web-based survey was conducted on the Syrian residents of 16 years and above. It contains questions on knowledge, attitudes and practices (KAP) with respect to COVID-19. Participants’ demographic characteristics are recorded and analyzed. The study is conducted during the global outbreak of COVID-19. RESULTS: A total of 706 participants (female, 444; male, 262) were enrolled. This study included 405 participants aged between 16 and 29, 204 aged between 30 and 49, and 97 aged above 60 years. There were 642 who have a university degree and 61 who have high school degree. Among the participants 253 were students, 316 were employed, 75 work as freelancers, and 62 were unemployed. Results showed that overall knowledge score towards the disease was about 60% (mean score 3.54 ± 1.20; range 0–6). Knowledge scores significantly differed across age groups (P < 0.05), education levels (P = 0.001), and occupations (P < 0.05). Attitude and practice scores were 2.45 ± 0.81 (range 0–4), 5.90 ± 1.52 (range 0–8), respectively. Attitude scores were significantly different between males and females (P < 0.05), whereas practice scores varied significantly across gender (P < 0.05), age groups (P = 0.01), education levels (P = 0.015), occupations (P < 0.05), and according to knowledge score (P = 0.000). Results from multiple linear regression indicated that lower knowledge scores were significantly associated with lower education level (P < 0.05), whereas poor preventive practices were common among male, young and unemployed participants with significance levels of P < 0.01, P = .000, P < 0.01, respectively. CONCLUSION: The findings of this study suggest that the Syrian residents demonstrate modest knowledge, attitudes and practices towards COVID-19 at the time of its global outbreak. Efforts should be directed towards raising the awareness of the disease to improve their practices in the current COVID-19 pandemic, as well as for future epidemics.

This paper investigates which cognitive, moral, and emotional traits separate people who comply with official recommendations from those who don't. In four studies (three pre-registered) on both U.S. and French samples, we found that individuals' self-reported compliance with official recommendations during the COVID-19 pandemic was partly driven by individual differences in moral values, disgust sensitivity, and psychological reactance.

PD-L1 immunohistochemistry has limited predictive value, possibly due to tumor heterogeneity of PD-L1 expression. Noninvasive PD-L1 imaging using 89Zr-durvalumab might provide a better reflection of tumor PD-L1 expression and can therefore support treatment decision making. Patients and Methods: NSCLC patients eligible for second line immunotherapy treatment were enrolled. Patients received two injections of 89Zr-durvalumab; one without a preceding dose of unlabeled durvalumab ('tracer dose only') and one with a preceding dose of 750 mg durvalumab, directly prior to tracer injection. Up to four PET/CT scans were obtained after tracer injection. Post-imaging acquisition, patients were treated with 750mg durvalumab every two weeks. Tracer biodistribution and tumor uptake were visually assessed and quantified as standardized uptake value (SUV) and both imaging acquisitions were compared. Tumor tracer uptake was correlated with PD-L1 expression and clinical outcome, defined as treatment response to durvalumab treatment. Results: Thirteen patients were included and ten completed all scheduled PET scans. No tracer related adverse events were observed and all patients started durvalumab treatment. Biodistribution analysis showed 89Zr-durvalumab accumulation in the blood pool, liver and spleen. Serial imaging showed that image acquisition 120 hours post injection delivered the best tumor to blood pool ratio. Most tumor lesions were visualized with the tracer-dose only versus the co-injection imaging acquisition (25% vs 13.5% of all lesions). Uptake heterogeneity was observed within (range SUVpeak 0.2 to 15.1) and between patients. Tumor uptake was higher in patients with treatment response or stable disease, compared to patients with disease progression according to RECIST 1.1. However, this difference was not statistically significant (median SUVpeak 4.9 vs 2.4, P = 0.06). SUVpeak correlated better with the combined tumor and immune cell PD-L1 score than with PD-L1 expression on tumor cells, although both were not statistically significant (P = 0.06 and P = 0.93, respectively). Conclusion: 89Zr-durvalumab was safe without any tracer related adverse events and more tumor lesions were visualized using the tracer dose only imaging acquisition. 89Zr-durvalumab tumor uptake was higher in patients with response to durvalumab treatment, but did not correlate with tumor PD-L1 IHC.",2021-08-12,"Smit, Jasper; Borm, Frank Johannes; Niemeijer, Anna-Larissa N; Huisman, Marc C; Hoekstra, Otto S; Boellaard, Ronald; Oprea-Lager, Daniela Elena; Vugts, Danielle J; van Dongen, Guus Ams; de Wit-van der Veen, Berlinda J; Thunnissen, Erik; Smit, Egbert F; de Langen, Adrianus J","Journal of nuclear medicine : official publication, Society of Nuclear Medicine",,,,,,https://doi.org/10.2967/jnumed.121.262473; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34385342/,236997649.0

OBJECTIVE To evaluate morphological changes to the CS after FDS deployment and their relationship with the rate of occlusion of intracranial aneurysms. METHODS A cohort of 183 patients with CS aneurysms were treated by deployment of Pipeline® FDS (Medtronic Inc, Dublin, Ireland). Their CSs were classified as type U, V, C, or S, depending on morphology. The posterior and anterior bend angles were measured on strict lateral cerebral angiogram with digital subtraction before FDS deployment, immediately after deployment, and at 6 mo. Differences between angles were analyzed to identify any correlations with rates of aneurysm occlusion, using the O'Kelly-Marotta classification. RESULTS FDS deployment was associated with immediate changes in CS morphology. The mean anterior angle increased from 3.97 ± 25.06° to 22.05 ± 25.18° (P < .001) and the mean posterior angle increased from 71.98 ± 31.27° to 79.43 ± 31.80° (P < .001). Multivariate analysis revealed a progressive, statistically significant increase in frequency of complete (grade D) occlusion at 6-mo follow-up with increasing anterior bend angle (prevalence ratios (PR) = 1.42 for increases between 5.3° and 12°, P = .017; PR = 1.56 for increases between 12.1° and 27.6°, P = .002; PR = 1.83 for increases >27.6°, P < .001, all vs increases <5.3°).

Although many factors have been identified that influence patient involvement in treatment decisions, little is known about the different views that patients have on which factors are most important. OBJECTIVE: This study explores the views of patients with a chronic condition on factors influencing their involvement in treatment decisions. DESIGN: Q‐methodology was used to study the views of patients. Respondents were asked to rank a set of 42 statements from the least important to the most important for active patient involvement in treatment decision‐making. The set of 42 statements was developed based on a literature search and a pilot in which two external researchers, 15 patients and four healthcare professionals participated. A total of 136 patients with one of three major chronic conditions were included: diabetes types 1 and 2, respiratory disease (i.e., chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and asthma) and cancer (i.e., breast cancer and prostate cancer). Data were collected in a face‐to‐face interview setting in the Netherlands. RESULTS: Four distinct views on the factors influencing active patient involvement were identified among patients with a chronic condition. (1) Enabled involvement: the extent to which patients are facilitated and empowered to participate will lead to patient involvement. (2) Relationship‐driven involvement: the relationship between patients and healthcare professionals drives patient involvement. (3) Disease impact‐driven involvement: the severity of disease drives patient involvement. (4) Cognition‐driven involvement: knowledge and information drive patient involvement. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION: From the patients' perspective, this study shows that there is no one‐size‐fits‐all approach to involving patients more actively in their healthcare journey. Strategies aiming to enhance active patient involvement among patients with a chronic condition should consider this diversity in perspectives among these patients.

These include two mutations in the N terminal domain (NTD) of the S protein, HV69-70del and Y144del (also known as Y145del due to the presence of tyrosine at both positions). We recently identified several emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants of concerns, characterized by Membrane (M) protein mutations, including I82T and V70L. We now identify a sub-lineage of B.1.1.7 that emerged through sequential acquisitions of M:V70L in November 2020 followed by a novel S:D178H mutation first observed in early February 2021. The percentage of B.1.1.7 isolates in the U.S. that belong to this sub-lineage increased from 0.15% in February 2021 to 1.8% in April 2021. To date this sub-lineage appears to be U.S.-specific with reported cases in 31 states, including Hawaii. As of April 2021 it constituted 36.8% of all B.1.1.7 isolates in Washington. Phylogenetic analysis and transmission inference with Nextstrain suggests this sub-lineage likely originated in either California or Washington. Structural analysis revealed that the S:D178H mutation is in the NTD of the S protein and close to two other signature mutations of B.1.1.7, HV69-70del and Y144del. It is surface exposed and may alter NTD tertiary configuration or accessibility, and thus has the potential to affect neutralization by NTD directed antibodies.",2021-05-18,"Shen, L.; Dien Bard, J.; Triche, T.

A French perspective,,,,unk,"The health crisis induced by the pandemic of coronavirus 2019 disease (COVID-19) has had a major impact on dialysis patients in France. The incidence of infection with acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) during the first wave of the COVID-19 epidemic was 3.3% among dialysis patients-13 times higher than in the general population. The corresponding mortality rate was high, reaching 21%. As of 19th April, 2021, the cumulative prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection in French dialysis patients was 14%. Convergent scientific data from France, Italy, the United Kingdom and Canada show that home dialysis reduces the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection by a factor of at least two. Unfortunately, home dialysis in France is not sufficiently developed: the proportion of dialysis patients being treated at home is only 7%. The obstacles to the provision of home care for patients with end-stage kidney disease in France include (i) an unfavourable pricing policy for home haemodialysis and nurse visits for assisted peritoneal dialysis (PD), (ii) insufficient training in home dialysis for nephrologists, (iii) the small number of administrative authorizations for home dialysis programs, and (iv) a lack of structured, objective information on renal replacement therapies for patients with advanced chronic kidney disease (CKD). We propose a number of pragmatic initiatives that could be simultaneously enacted to improve the situation in three areas: (i) the provision of objective information on renal replacement therapies for patients with advanced CKD, (ii) wider authorization of home dialysis networks and (iii) price increases in favour of home dialysis procedures.",2021,"Rostoker, Guy; Issad, Belkacem; Fessi, Hafedh; Massy, Ziad A",J. nephrol,,#covidwho-1248762,,,,,235259654.0

During the first term, various national social distancing measures were introduced, including banning groups of >6 people and the second lockdown in November; however, outbreaks among university students occurred. We aimed to measure the University of Bristol staff and student contact patterns via an online, longitudinal survey capturing self-reported contacts on the previous day. We investigated the change in contacts associated with COVID-19 guidance periods: post-first lockdown (23/06/2020–03/07/2020), relaxed guidance period (04/07/2020–13/09/2020), ‘rule-of-six’ period (14/09/2020–04/11/2020) and the second lockdown (05/11/2020–25/11/2020). In total, 722 staff (4199 responses) and 738 students (1906 responses) were included in the study. For staff, daily contacts were higher in the relaxed guidance and ‘rule-of-six’ periods than the post-first lockdown and second lockdown. Mean student contacts dropped between the ‘rule-of-six’ and second lockdown periods. For both staff and students, the proportion meeting with groups larger than six dropped between the ‘rule-of-six’ period and the second lockdown period, although was higher for students than for staff. Our results suggest university staff and students responded to national guidance by altering their social contacts. Most contacts during the second lockdown were household contacts. The response in staff and students was similar, suggesting that students can adhere to social distancing guidance while at university.

This protocol describes the setup of Health Telescope, a longitudinal panel study in which the long-term effects of mobile electronic health (eHealth) apps are investigated. By setting up Health Telescope, we aim to (1) understand more about the long-term use of eHealth apps in an externally valid setting, (2) understand the relationships between short-term and long-term outcomes of the usage of eHealth apps, and (3) test different ways in which eHealth app allocation can be personalized. OBJECTIVE: The objectives of this paper are to (1) demonstrate and motivate the validity of the many choices that we made in setting up an intensive longitudinal study, (2) provide a resource for researchers interested in using data generated by our study, and (3) act as a guideline for researchers interested in setting up their own longitudinal data collection using wearable devices. For the third objective, we explicitly discuss the General Data Protection Regulation and ethical requirements that need to be addressed. METHODS: In this 4-month study, a group of approximately 450 participants will have their daily step count measured and will be asked daily about their mood using experience sampling. Once per month, participants will receive an intervention containing a recommendation to download an app that focuses on increasing physical activity. The mechanism for assigning recommendations to participants will be personalized over time, using contextual data obtained from previous interventions. RESULTS: The data collection software has been developed, and all the legal and ethical checks are in place. Recruitment will start in Q4 of 2020. The initial results will be published in 2021. CONCLUSIONS: The aim of Health Telescope is to investigate how different individuals respond to different ways of being encouraged to increase their physical activity. In this paper, we detail the setup, methods, and analysis plan that will enable us to reach this aim.

Starting in Wuhan, the capital of China’s Hubei province, it has spread it spread throughout the world in less than four months and has caused thousands of deaths. The WHO has declared it to be a pandemic. Humanity is shocked, and many governments have imposed total isolation. It has had varying success due to community negligence. In many cities, institutions and health personnel have not successfully managed this catastrophe. Isolation is the only effective strategy to stop the logarithmic growth of COVID 19. The scientific reason for isolation is that more than 60 % of infections arise from asymptomatic people. SARS-CoV-2 not only produces respiratory symptoms but can also cause nausea, abdominal pain, vomiting, diarrhea, anosmia and ageusia. Fifty percent of those infected may have digestive symptoms which may even precede respiratory symptoms. The fecal-oral route can transmit the virus even when there is no diarrhea. All forms of contagion are found in endoscopy units: aerosols from vomiting, retching, bel-ching, and flatus; fecal matter, close contact, and contamination of the environment. All diagnostic endoscopies should be discontinued. Only urgent and therapeutic endoscopy should be performed. All endoscopy personnel must have strict protection measures. Each patient should be informed, and sign an informed consent form, that the virus can be spread within the endoscopy room. After performance of endoscopy, the patient should be contacted by phone on days 7 and 14 to inquire about all symptoms mentioned.",2020,"Otero, William; Gómez, Martín; Ángel, Luis A.; Ruiz, Oscar; Marulanda, Hernando; Riveros, Javier; Junca, Germán; Ballén, Hernán; Rodríguez, Álvaro; Pineda, Luis F.; Otero, Elder; Otero, Lina; Jaramillo, Gilberto; Buitrago, Johanna; Rodríguez, Jairo; Bastidas, Melissa",Rev.

COVID-19 belongs to the Bettacoronavirus genus of the Coronaviridae family, and it mainly spreads through the respiratory tract. Studies have now confirmed a human-to-human transmission as the primary pathway of spread. COVID-19 patients with a history of diseases such as respiratory system diseases, immune deficiency, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and cancer are prone to adverse events (admission to the intensive care unit requiring invasive ventilation or even death). The current focus has been on the development of novel therapeutics, including antivirals, monoclonal antibodies, and vaccines. However, although there is undoubtedly an urgent need to identify effective treatment options against infection with COVID-19, it is equally important to clarify management protocols for the other significant diseases from which these patients may suffer, including cancer. This review summarizes the current evidence regarding the epidemiology, pathogenesis, and management of patients with COVID-19. It also aims to provide the reader with insights into COVID-19 in pregnant patients and those with cancer, outlining necessary precautions relevant to cancer patients.

Additionally, to examine whether data availability statements are sufficient to capture code availability declarations. DESIGN: Observational study, following a pre-registered protocol, of preprints posted on the medRxiv repository between 25th June 2019 and 1st May 2020 and their published counterparts. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Distribution of preprinted data availability statements across nine categories, determined by a prespecified classification system. Change in the percentage of data availability statements describing open data between the preprinted and published versions of the same record, stratified by journal sharing policy. Number of code availability declarations reported in the full-text preprint which were not captured in the corresponding data availability statement. RESULTS: 3938 medRxiv preprints with an applicable data availability statement were included in our sample, of which 911 (23.1%) were categorized as describing open data. 379 (9.6%) preprints were subsequently published, and of these published articles, only 155 contained an applicable data availability statement. Similar to the preprint stage, a minority (59 (38.1%)) of these published data availability statements described open data. Of the 151 records eligible for the comparison between preprinted and published stages, 57 (37.7%) were published in journals which mandated open data sharing. Data availability statements more frequently described open data on publication when the journal mandated data sharing (open at preprint: 33.3%, open at publication: 61.4%) compared to when the journal did not mandate data sharing (open at preprint: 20.2%, open at publication: 22.3%). CONCLUSION: Requiring that authors submit a data availability statement is a good first step, but is insufficient to ensure data availability. Strict editorial policies that mandate data sharing (where appropriate) as a condition of publication appear to be effective in making research data available. We would strongly encourage all journal editors to examine whether their data availability policies are sufficiently stringent and consistently enforced.",2021-05-13,"McGuinness, Luke A.; Sheppard, Athena L.",PLoS One,,,,document_parses/pdf_json/a2a8ab6926657650e83a6705753e43bab539de04.json,document_parses/pmc_json/PMC8118451.xml.json,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33983972/; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0250887,234495300.0

When compared to the control groups, the total effective rate of the national institutes of health stroke scale (NIHSS) was higher in the experimental group with DZHS (RR = 1.23, 95% CI = 1.19 to 1.28, P < 0.001; RR = 1.29, 95% CI = 1.21 to 1.38, P < 0.001); clinical symptoms and signs were improved in the experimental group with DZHS (RR = 1.17, 95% CI = 1.10 to 1.24, P < 0.001; RR = 1.25, 95% CI = 1.11 to 1.42, P < 0.001); the incidence of adverse reactions was reduced in the experimental group with DZHS (RR = 0.50, 95% CI = 0.26 to 0.98, P = 0.044); and the NIHSS score was decreased in the experimental group with DZHS (WMD = -3.30, 95% CI = -3.86 to -2.73, P < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS DZHS combined with CT is conditionally recommended to improve the total effective rate of the NIHSS, clinical symptoms, and neurological deficits and reduce the incidence of adverse reactions, and no serious adverse reactions were noted. The GRADE assessment indicates that the overall certainty quality of evidence is low. Further large-scale, well-designed and high-quality RCTs are needed to confirm the positive results.

Interventions to alleviate the psychological impact of the pandemic are urgently needed. Whether mindfulness practice may protect against the harmful emotional effects of a pandemic crisis remains hitherto unknown. We investigated the influence of mindfulness training on mental health during the COVID-19 outbreak in China. We hypothesized that mindfulness practitioners might manifest less pandemic-related distress, depression, anxiety, and stress than non-practitioners and that more frequent practice would be associated with an improvement in mental health during the pandemic. Therefore, we assessed pandemic-related distress and symptoms of depression, anxiety, and stress, as well as the frequency of meditation practice at the peak of new infections (Feb 4-5; N = 673) and three weeks later (Feb 29-30; N = 521) in mindfulness practitioners via online questionnaires. Self-reported symptoms were also collected from non-practitioners at peak time only (N = 1550). We found lower scores of pandemic-related distress in mindfulness practitioners compared to non-practitioners. In general, older participants showed fewer symptoms of depression and anxiety. In younger practitioners, pandemic-related distress decreased from peak to follow-up. Importantly, increased mindfulness training during the preceding two weeks was associated with lower scores of depression and anxiety at both assessments. Likewise, practice frequency predicted individual improvement in scores of depression, anxiety, and stress at follow-up.

Patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 (n = 215) treated at the First Affiliated Hospital of Nanchang University from January 24 to March 12, 2020, were included in the study and classified into severe and non-severe groups. Peripheral immunocyte count and cytokine statuses were compared. The correlation between immune status, cytokine levels, and disease severity was analyzed. Leukocyte numbers were normal in both groups; however, they were relatively high (7.19 × 109/L) in patients of the severe group. Leukocyte distributions differed between the two groups; the severe group had a higher percentage of neutrophils and lower percentage of lymphocytes compared with the non-severe group, and absolute lymphocyte numbers were below normal in both groups, and particularly deficient in patients in the severe group. Lymphocyte counts have negative correlation with duration of hospital period whereas neutrophil count has no significant correlation with it. Of tested cytokines, IL-6 levels were significantly higher in the severe group (P = 0.0418). Low level of lymphocyte predicts severity of COVID-19. IL-6 levels were significantly higher in the severe group, especially in some extremely severe patients.

Development of a cure for this devastating disease is currently at full speed, with several vaccines against COVID-19 already authorized and administered. Currently, demand for these vaccines far exceeds supply. As such, boosting immunity represents a viable route to halt the rapid spread of SARS-CoV-2 and limit fatalities until vaccines become more readily and widely available. The use of phytochemicals appears to be a promising panacea. Sesamin, a lignan isolated from Sesamum indicum seeds, is known for its potent pharmacological properties, and is therefore hypothesized as a potential candidate in the therapeutic regimen against COVID-19. Herein, we highlight the confirmed therapeutic anti-inflammatory and immune-modulatory potential of sesamin against myriads of respiratory disorders, and tentatively suggest that sesamin may exert similar potent effects against COVID-19. Precisely, we speculate that sesamin may help alleviate COVID-19 via restoring Th1/Th2 balance and preventing inflammation and cytokine storm development. Additionally, we further support the promising role of sesamin against COVID-19 by underscoring the direct evidence, which suggests that sesamin may demonstrate promising inhibitory potential against three important SARS-CoV-2 targets, namely main protease, spike protein, and angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 receptor. Although preliminary, there is ample evidence to propose sesamin as a potential phytotherapeutic and prophylactic candidate against COVID-19.

Persistent oxidative stress during diabetes contributes to coronary endothelial dysfunction. The mitochondria are main sources of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in diabetes, and mitochondria-targeted antioxidant mito-Tempo can prevent mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (mROS) generation in a variety of disorders. Inhibition/inactivation of small-conductance Ca(2+)-activated K(+) (SK) channels contribute to diabetic downregulation of coronary endothelial function/relaxation. However, few investigated the role of mROS on endothelial dysfunction/vasodilation and endothelial SK channel downregulation in diabetes. The aim of present study was to investigate the chronic administration of mito-Tempo, on coronary vasodilation, and endothelial SK channel activity of mice with or without diabetes. Mito-Tempo (1 mg/kg/day) was applied to the mice with or without diabetes (n = 10/group) for 4 weeks. In vitro relaxation response of pre-contracted arteries was examined in the presence or absence of the vasodilatory agents. SK channel currents of the isolated mouse heart endothelial cells were measured using whole-cell patch clamp methods. At baseline, coronary endothelium-dependent relaxation responses to ADP and the selective SK channel activator NS309 and endothelial SK channel currents were decreased in diabetic mice compared with that in non-diabetic (ND) mice (p < 0.05). After a 4-week treatment with mito-Tempo, coronary endothelium-dependent relaxation response to ADP or NS309 and endothelial SK channel currents in the diabetic mice was significantly improved when compared with that in untreated diabetic mice (p < 0.05). Interestingly, coronary relaxation responses to ADP and NS309 and endothelial SK channel currents were not significantly changed in ND mice after mito-Tempo treatment, as compared to that of untreated control group.

Spike proteins of SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2 virions, being structurally related but not identical, mediate attachment to the human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (hACE2) receptor in similar but non-identical ways. Molecular-level understanding of interactions between spike proteins and hACE2 can aid strategies for blocking attachment of SARS-CoV-1, a potentially reemerging health threat, to human cells. We have identified dominant molecular-level interactions, some attractive and some repulsive, between the receptor binding domain of SARS-CoV-1 spike proteins (S-RBD) and hACE2. We performed fragment-based quantum-biochemical calculations which directly relate biomolecular structure to the hACE2...S-RBD interaction energy. Consistent with X-ray crystallography and cryo-EM, the interaction energy between hACE2 and S-RBD ([Formula: see text]26 kcal/mol) corresponds to a net intermolecular attraction which is significantly enhanced by inclusion of dispersion van der Waals forces. Protein fragments at the hACE2...S-RBD interface, that dominate host-virus attraction, have been identified together with their constituent amino acid residues.

viwu7ag2,,WHO,Learning about COVID-19: a qualitative interview study of Australians' use of information sources,,,,unk,"BACKGROUND: A multitude of information sources are available to publics when novel infectious diseases first emerge. In this paper, we adopt a qualitative approach to investigate how Australians learnt about the novel coronavirus and COVID-19 and what sources of information they had found most useful and valuable during the early months of the pandemic. METHODS: In-depth semi-structured telephone interviews were conducted with a diverse group of 40 Australian adults in mid-2020 about their experiences of the COVID-19 crisis. Participants were recruited through Facebook advertising. Detailed case studies were created for each participant, providing the basis of a thematic analysis which focused on the participants' responses to the questions about COVID-19-related information sources. RESULTS: Diverse sources of COVID-19-related information, including traditional media, online media and in-person interactions, were actively accessed, appraised and engaged with by participants. There was a high level of interest in COVID-19 information as people grappled with uncertainty, anxiety and feeling overwhelmed. Certain key events or experiences made people become aware that the outbreak was threatening Australia and potentially themselves. Most people demonstrated keen awareness that misinformation was rife in news outlets and social media sites and that they were taking steps to determine the accuracy of information. High trust was placed in health experts, scientists and government sources to provide reliable information. Also important to participants were informal discussions with friends and family members who were experts or working in relevant fields, as well as engaging in-person in interactions and hearing from friends and family who lived overseas about what COVID-19 conditions were like there. CONCLUSION: A constantly changing news environment raises challenges for effective communication of risk and containment advice. People can become confused, distressed and overwhelmed by the plethora of information sources and fast-changing news environment. On the other hand, seeking out information can provide reassurance and comfort in response to anxiety and uncertainty. Clarity and consistency in risk messaging is important, as is responding quickly to changes in information and misinformation.

The actual number of infections potentially exceeds the number of confirmed cases. DEVELOPMENT: We develop a demographic scaling model to estimate COVID-19 infections, based on minimal data requirements: COVID-19-related deaths, infection fatality rates (IFRs), and life tables. As many countries lack IFR estimates, we scale them from a reference country based on remaining lifetime to better match the context in a target population with respect to age structure, health conditions and medical services. We introduce formulas to account for bias in input data and provide a heuristic to assess whether local seroprevalence estimates are representative for the total population. APPLICATION: Across 10 countries with most reported COVID-19 deaths as of 23 July 2020, the number of infections is estimated to be three [95% prediction interval: 2–8] times the number of confirmed cases. Cross-country variation is high. The estimated number of infections is 5.3 million for the USA, 1.8 million for the UK, 1.4 million for France, and 0.4 million for Peru, or more than one, six, seven and more than one times the number of confirmed cases, respectively. Our central prevalence estimates for entire countries are markedly lower than most others based on local seroprevalence studies.

Hence, in order to prevent ARDS, the pulmonary function maintenance has been the target of several pharmacological approaches. However, there is a lack of reports regarding the use of effective pharmaceutical active natural products (PANPs) for early treatment and prevention of COVID-19-related ARDS. Therefore, the aim of this work was to conduct a systematic review regarding the PANPs that could be further studied as alternatives to prevent ARDS. Consequently, this work can pave the way to spread the use of PANPs on the prevention of ARDS in COVID-19-confirmed or -suspected patients. METHODS: The search strategy included scientific studies published in English from 2015 to 2020 that promoted the elucidation of anti-inflammatory pathways targeting ARDS by in vitro and/or in vivo experiments using PANPs. Then, 74 studies regarding PANPs, able to maintain or improve the pulmonary function, were reported. CONCLUSIONS: The PANPs may present different pulmonary anti-inflammatory pathways, wherein (i) reduction/attenuation of pro-inflammatory cytokines, (ii) increase of the anti-inflammatory mediators' levels, (iii) pulmonary edema inhibition and (iv) attenuation of lung injury were the most observed biological effects of such products in in vitro experiments or in clinical studies. Finally, this work highlighted the PANPs with promising potential to be used on respiratory syndromes, allowing their possible use as alternative treatment at the prevention of ARDS in COVID-19-infected or -suspected patients.",2021,"Amaral-Machado, Lucas; Oliveira, Wógenes N; Rodrigues, Victor M; Albuquerque, Nathan A; Alencar, Éverton N; Egito, Eryvaldo S T",Biomed Pharmacother,,#978231,,,,,229691225.0

The novel compound STR-324 belongs to the DENKI pharmacological class. This first-in-human study evaluated safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of STR-324 in healthy male participants. METHODS This was a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled ascending dosing study including two parts: in part 1, 30 participants received 0.004-11.475mg h-1 of STR-324 or placebo (ratio 4:1) by 4h intravenous infusion in a two-group, partial cross-over design with four treatment periods separated by one month wash-out, and in part 2, 48 participants divided into three groups received either the active drug (1.25-11.25mg h-1) or placebo (ratio 3:1) by 48h intravenous infusion. Safety and tolerability parameters, pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamic effects on neurocognitive and neurophysiological tasks and on a nociceptive test battery were evaluated. RESULTS No clinically relevant changes in safety parameters were observed. All treatment-emergent adverse events were mild and transient. Pharmacokinetics of STR-324 could not be determined due to most concentrations being below quantifiable limits. STR-324 metabolite concentrations were measurable, showing dose proportionality of Cmax and AUCinf with an estimated T1/2 of 0.2-0.5h. Significant changes on pharmacodynamic parameters were observed, however these were not consistent or dose-dependent. CONCLUSION STR-324 displayed favourable safety and tolerability profiles at all doses up to 11.475mg h-1. Although pharmacokinetic characterisation of STR-324 was limited, dose proportionality could be assumed based on major metabolite data assayed as proxy.

Unfortunately, these benefits are not widely known among health care personnel and the general public. As a result, most of the world’s population has serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) concentrations far below optimal values. This narrative review examines the evidence for the major causes of death including cardiovascular disease, hypertension, cancer, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and COVID-19 with regard to sub-optimal 25(OH)D concentrations. Evidence for the beneficial effects comes from a variety of approaches including ecological and observational studies, studies of mechanisms, and Mendelian randomization studies. Although randomized controlled trials (RCTs) are generally considered the strongest form of evidence for pharmaceutical drugs, the study designs and the conduct of RCTs performed for vitamin D have mostly been flawed for the following reasons: they have been based on vitamin D dose rather than on baseline and achieved 25(OH)D concentrations; they have involved participants with 25(OH)D concentrations above the population mean; they have given low vitamin D doses; and they have permitted other sources of vitamin D. Thus, the strongest evidence generally comes from the other types of studies. The general finding is that optimal 25(OH)D concentrations to support health and wellbeing are above 30 ng/mL (75 nmol/L) for cardiovascular disease and all-cause mortality rate, whereas the thresholds for several other outcomes appear to range up to 40 or 50 ng/mL. The most efficient way to achieve these concentrations is through vitamin D supplementation.

We build on both public health considerations, in which engagement, cost and scalability are paramount, and a developmental psychopathology framework (Cicchetti & Toth, Journal of Child Psychology and Psychiatry, and Allied Disciplines 50:16–25, 2009), in which the child is considered within the context of the proximal caregiving environment. Whereas existing early preventive models have shown promise in promoting children’s school readiness, the Smart Beginnings model addresses three important barriers that have limited impacts at the individual and/or population level: (1) identification and engagement of vulnerable families; (2) the challenges of scalability at low cost within existing service systems; and (3) tailoring interventions to address the heterogeneity of risk among low-income families. Smart Beginnings takes advantage of the existing platform of pediatric primary care to provide a universal primary prevention strategy for all families (Video Interaction Project) and a targeted secondary/tertiary prevention strategy (Family Check-Up) for families with additional contextual factors.

METHODS: A qualitative program evaluation was conducted by interviewing providers and patients, assessing perceptions of effectiveness and barriers to success. RESULTS: Providers felt their workload was alleviated and believed the program was addressing the social determinants of health. Patients similarly felt that their needs were met but acknowledged some barriers to accessing resources such as transportation, business hours, and language barriers. Ultimately, patients and providers viewed the program as effective but both groups perceived structural barriers such as housing and limited resources.

The diagnosis of PM was made with thick blood smear, qPCR, and histopathology. Immuno-histochemical was made with EnVision system (Dako) and Zeiss Axio Imager M2 with light microscope. Cells in apoptosis were studied with the TUNEL technique. To measure the expression level of cytokines and mediators qRT-PCR was used. We included 179 placentas without PM and 87 with PM (53% P. vivax and 47% P. falciparum). At delivery, anemia was 25% in negative-PM, 60% in vivax-PM, and 44% in falciparum-PM group. The neonatal weight had an intense difference between groups with 3292±394g in negative-PM, 2,841±239 in vivax-PM, and 2,957±352 in falciparum-PM. The histopathological characteristics and CD+ cells in placenta with statistical differences (Dunn´s test) between negative-PM vs vivax-PM (P. falciparum was similar to P. vivax) were infarction, fibrinoid deposits, calcification, cells in apoptosis, immune infiltrates in decidua and intervillous space, CD4+, CD8+, CD14+, CD56+, CD68+.

Application to the Covid-19 epidemic,,,,unk,"The paper is devoted to a compartmental epidemiological model of infection progression in a heterogeneous population which consists of two groups with high disease transmission (HT) and low disease transmission (LT) potentials. Final size and duration of epidemic, the total and current maximal number of infected individuals are estimated depending on the structure of the population. It is shown that with the same basic reproduction number R0 in the beginning of epidemic, its further progression depends on the ratio between the two groups. Therefore, fitting the data in the beginning of epidemic and the determination of R0 are not sufficient to predict its long time behaviour. Available data on the Covid-19 epidemic allows the estimation of the proportion of the HT and LT groups. Estimated structure of the population is used for the investigation of the influence of vaccination on further epidemic development. The result of vaccination strongly depends on the proportion of vaccinated individuals between the two groups. Vaccination of the HT group acts to stop the epidemic and essentially decreases the total number of infected individuals at the end of epidemic and the current maximal number of infected individuals while vaccination of the LT group only acts to protect vaccinated individuals from further infection.",2021,"Volpert, Vitaly Banerjee Malay Sharma Swarnali",Ecological Complexity,,#covidwho-1244727,,,,,227321463.0

The effectiveness of interactive marketing will only be increased by having focus on the fundamental roles of the marketing discipline, strategy and segmentation, and understanding customers at the individual level. We also need reminding briefly that the rules of competition had changed well before the COVID-19 pandemic. The traditional make and sell model has been substantially replaced by new technology-enabled organisations without the restrictions of high fixed costs and cloying bureaucracy. Customers can now search for and evaluate products and services independent of suppliers and now have as much information about suppliers as suppliers have of customers. This is the backcloth against which marketers face the challenges at the beginning of 2021. We conclude that there is a great future ahead. There is no reason why the best of interactive marketing will not be capable of building relationships that are great for customers, great for the people who create them, great for all stakeholders and great for the environment.Originality/valueThis is a practitioner viewpoint outlining the view that COVID-19 has not had as great of an impact on interactive marketing practice as technological change has and that interactive marketing will continue to develop after COVID-19 has receded.",2022,"McDonald, Malcolm",Journal of Research in Interactive Marketing,,#covidwho-1703670,,,,https://doi.org/10.1108/jrim-03-2021-0092,238732452.0

Sulforaphane, in turn, is an inducer of cytoprotective enzymes through activation of Nrf2 signaling, and a potent inhibitor of carcinogenesis in multiple murine models. Sulforaphane is also protective in models of diabetes, neurodegenerative disease, and other inflammatory processes, likely reflecting additional actions of Nrf2 and interactions with other signaling pathways. Translating this efficacy into the design and implementation of clinical chemoprevention trials, especially food-based trials, faces numerous challenges including the selection of the source, placebo, and dose as well as standardization of the formulation of the intervention material. Unlike in animals, purified sulforaphane has had very limited use in clinical studies. We have conducted a series of clinical studies and randomized clinical trials to evaluate the effects of composition (glucoraphanin-rich [± myrosinase] vs. sulforaphane-rich or mixture beverages), formulation (beverage vs. tablet) and dose, on the efficacy of these broccoli sprout-based preparations to evaluate safety, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamic action, and clinical benefit.

jqya14v3,,Medline,De novo initiation of RNA synthesis by the arterivirus RNA-dependent RNA polymerase.,,,17537850.0,unk,"All plus-strand RNA viruses encode an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) that functions as the catalytic subunit of the viral replication/transcription complex, directing viral RNA synthesis in concert with other viral proteins and, sometimes, host proteins. RNA synthesis essentially can be initiated by two different mechanisms, de novo initiation and primer-dependent initiation. Most viral RdRps have been identified solely on the basis of comparative sequence analysis, and for many viruses the mechanism of initiation is unknown. In this study, using the family prototype equine arteritis virus (EAV), we address the mechanism of initiation of RNA synthesis in arteriviruses. The RdRp domains of the members of the arterivirus family, which are part of replicase subunit nsp9, were compared to coronavirus RdRps that belong to the same order of Nidovirales, as well as to other RdRps with known initiation mechanisms and three-dimensional structures. We report here the first successful expression and purification of an arterivirus RdRp that is catalytically active in the absence of other viral or cellular proteins. The EAV nsp9/RdRp initiates RNA synthesis by a de novo mechanism on homopolymeric templates in a template-specific manner. In addition, the requirements for initiation of RNA synthesis from the 3' end of the viral genome were studied in vivo using a reverse genetics approach.

Previously, we demonstrated that DING regulates HIV-1 gene transcription by dephosphorylation and inactivation of CTD RNA polymerase II, the major elongating factor of HIV-1 Long Terminal Repeats (LTR). Because the transcription of HIV-1 is controlled by several viral and cellular factors, including p65/p50 subunits of NF-κB, we hypothesized that DING phosphatase can also affect the phosphorylation and activity of p65 NF-κB, in addition to C-terminal Domain (CTD) of RNA Polymerase II (RNAPII), to suppress HIV-1 gene transcription and inhibit HIV-1 infection. METHODS: Here, we describe the inhibition of HIV-1 infection and the p65/p50 NF-κB phosphorylation by DING protein, analyzed by ELISA and northern-blot assays, western-blot assays, cell fractionation, and promoter-reporter assays in DING-expressing cells, using a pTet-on inducible system. RESULTS: Results from HIV-1 infection assays demonstrate a strong inhibition of HIV-1 and HIV-LTR RNA expression by DING protein, determined by p24 ELISA and by northern blot assay. Results from the western blot assays and cell fractionation assays show that there is an increase in the level of hypo-phosphorylated form of p65 NF-κB in DING-expressing cells. Both fractions of p65/p50, nuclear or cytoplasmic, are affected by DING phosphatase, but more cytoplasmic accumulation of p65 NF-κB was found in the presence of DING, suggesting that subsequent activation and nuclear import of active NF-κB is affected by DING. The major portion of nuclear p65 was dephosphorylated in DING-expressing cells. The promoter-reporter assay demonstrated that DING-mediated dephosphorylation and dysregulation of NF-κB p65 lead to the suppression of its binding to HIV-1 LTR, and resulted in the inhibition of p65-mediated activation of LTR transcription. Mapping of the region within LTR that was affected by DING revealed that both, NF-κB and CTD RNA Polymerase II binding sites were important, and cooperativity of these cellular factors was diminished by DING. In addition, mapping of the region within DING-p38SJ that affected LTR transcription, revealed that phosphate-binding domain is essential for this inhibitory activity. CONCLUSION: We have demonstrated the effect of DING phosphatases on HIV-1 infection, phosphorylation of p65 NF-κB, and transcription of HIV-1 LTR. Our studies suggest that one possible mechanism by which DING can regulate the expression of HIV-1 LTR can be through dysregulation of the transcription factor NF-κB p65 by preventing its phosphorylation and translocation to the nucleus and binding to the HIV-1 LTR, an action that could contribute to the utility of DING p38SJ as an antiviral agent. Importantly, DING not only inhibits HIV-1 LTR gene transcription in the presence of increased p65 NF-κB, but also suppresses HIV-1 infection. DING protein improved inhibitory effects of the known anti-retroviral drugs, Tenofovir (TFV) and Emtricitabine (FTS) on HIV-1, since in the combination with these drugs; the suppression of HIV-1 by DNG was significantly higher when it was in combination with these drugs, compared to controls or cases without DING. Thus, our data support the use of neuroprotective DING proteins as novel therapeutic antiviral drugs that suppress HIV-1 LTR transcription by interfering with the function of NF-κB.",2020-08-31,"Darbinian, Nune; Darbinyan, Armine; Merabova, Nana; Gomberg, Rebeccah; Chabriere, Erik; Simm, Malgorzata; Selzer, Michael E; Amini, Shohreh",J HIV AIDS,,,,document_parses/pdf_json/9e236b429eace3a13d396be1e8f10c98d90f364f.json,document_parses/pmc_json/PMC8296972.xml.json,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34307877/; https://doi.org/10.16966/2380-5536.175,229639266.0

We train LSD feedforward neural networks and random forests on Monte Carlo simulations of spectrally colored absorbed energy spectra, to apply the trained models to real OA measurements. We validate our combined MI-LSD method on a highly reliable, reproducible, and easily scalable phantom model, based on copper and nickel sulfate solutions. RESULTS: With this sulfate model, we see a consistently high estimation accuracy using MI-LSD, with median absolute estimation errors of 2.5 to 4.5 percentage points. We further find fewer outliers in MI-LSD estimates compared with LSD. Random forest regressors outperform previously reported neural network approaches.

This annual review of publications in hepatobiliary pathology highlights recent pathologic studies that can be applied to the daily practice of interpreting liver biopsy, explant, and postmortem specimens. RECENT FINDINGS The problem of the fatty liver was the subject of many studies. In chronic hepatitis C, genotype 3 infection results in moderate to marked fat that is ameliorated with successful antiviral therapy. In nonalcoholic steatohepatitis, in which the metabolic syndrome is often operative, gene microarray analysis showed altered expression of genes involved in insulin sensitivity and maintenance of mitochondrial function. Pathologic changes affecting centrilobular regions were described in the context of heart disease, Budd-Chiari syndrome, and the sinusoidal obstruction syndrome (venoocclusive disease). A mutation in ferroportin 1 produced a form of hemochromatosis with excessive iron in hepatocytes and also in Kupffer cells and macrophages. Immunostains for Hep Par 1 and polyclonal carcinoembryonic antigen remain important cornerstones in the immunohistochemical diagnosis of hepatocellular carcinoma and its distinction from metastatic adenocarcinoma and cholangiocarcinoma.

Convalescent plasma is an adjunct treatment used in emerging infectious diseases in past epidemics. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to determine the outcome and clinical course of COVID-19 patients who received convalescent plasma (CP) transfusion at Cardinal Santos Medical Center. METHODS: This is a retrospective cohort analytical study of 75 patients who received convalescent plasma. RESULTS: Median time from admission to CP transfusion was 3 days. Majority of patients received additional therapies including dexamethasone (100%), antibiotics (100%), remdesivir (95%), hemoperfusion (88%), tocilizumab (65%), or combinations of these. Among the survivors, the median length of stay (LOS) was 15 days while non-survivors had a median LOS of 6 days. One patient (1.33%) had a mild transfusion reaction. Four patients (5.33%) developed deep vein thrombosis despite anticoagulation. There was improvement in the inflammatory markers (LDH p value 0.04, CRP p value 0.00, Ferritin p value 0.0001). There was improvement in the pulmonary parameters-increase in mean PaO2, mean SaO2, and mean PFR;and decrease in mean FiO2 and mean RR post-treatment.

With the COVID-19 outbreak, there has been an increase in reports associating cardiotoxicity with hydroxychloroquine. It is unclear if the cardiotoxic profile of hydroxychloroquine is previously underreported in the literature or is it a manifestation of COVID-19 and therapeutic interventions. This manuscript evaluates the incidence of cardiotoxicity associated with hydroxychloroquine prior to the onset of COVID-19. METHODS: PubMED, EMBASE, and Cochrane databases were searched for keywords derived from MeSH terms prior to April 9, 2020. Inclusion eligibility was based on appropriate reporting of cardiac conditions and study design. RESULTS: A total of 69 articles were identified (58 case reports, 11 case series). The majority (84%) of patients were female, with a median age of 49.2 (range 16-92) years. 15 of 185 patients with cardiotoxic events were in the setting of acute intentional overdose. In acute overdose, the median ingestion was 17,857 ± 14,873 mg. 2 of 15 patients died after acute intoxication.

We know little currently about how satisfied physicians are with this type of patient care. The present systematic review examines physician satisfaction with telehealth, as physician acceptance remains vital to telehealth gaining wider and more permanent adoption. METHODS: A PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses)-guided systematic review of empirical articles published between 2010 and 2020 that contain a finding examining physician satisfaction with using telehealth, using 4 article databases (PubMed, Web of Science, COCHRANE, and CINAHL), to identify relevant studies. A standardized data abstraction Excel sheet was used to extract relevant information from each of the included studies. Relevant study findings related to physician satisfaction with telehealth were reviewed for each of the 37 studies by the coauthors. RESULTS: A total of 37 published studies were included in the review. Thirty-three of the 37 (89%) studies reviewed were classified as having findings showing moderate to high levels of physician satisfaction with telehealth. Just under 60% of the studies focused on physician satisfaction with providing telemedicine to patients (21/37). Twelve other studies focused on physician satisfaction with teleconsultations with other providers. Four studies examined physician satisfaction with both. The type of patient telemedicine or provider teleconsultation performed varied greatly across the 37 studies, with several different diagnoses or care situations included. Research designs used in the studies were less robust, with all studies using primary data for assessing physician satisfaction but only one study providing any type of multivariate analysis of physician satisfaction with telehealth. CONCLUSION: The results of this review support the observation that physicians across different specialties, geographic locations, practice locations, and care situations appear satisfied with engaging in telehealth for both patient care and consultations with other physicians.

METHODS: We performed a single-center, retrospective observational study in critically ill patients with acute kidney injury or end-stage renal disease and evaluated the association of peak serum lactate levels with citrate intolerance (CI) during the initial 72 hours of RCA-CVVH, defined by serum total-to-ionized calcium >2.5 plus systemic hypocalcemia. RESULTS: Eighty-eight patients were studied (aged 59 ± 14 years, 66% males, Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II: 31 ± 8). Citrate was dosed at median 2.1 mmol/L of blood flow, with citrate load of 30 mmol/h, and CVVH effluent of 43 mL/kg/h. Twenty patients developed CI. Comparing patients with CI versus none, peak lactate levels were 8 (5-11) versus 3 (2-6) mmol/L, calcium replacement was 13 (10-17) versus 11 (8-12) mmol/h, and standard base excess was -4 (-12 to 1) versus 2(-4 to 7) mmol/L, respectively ( P < .05). Citrate intolerance developed in 38%, 44%, and 55%, in patients with peak lactate >4, >6, >7 mmol/L, respectively, versus 7% in those with peak lactate ≤4 mmol/L ( P ≤ .001), despite comparable citrate load and effluent rates across all categories. On multivariate analysis, hyperlactatemia and hyperbilirubinemia predicted CI ( P ≤ .01), which was associated with increasing calcium infusion requirement. Higher peak lactate from >4 to >7 mmol/L predicted CI with graded increase in odds ratio and specificity from 59% to 87%, but the corresponding negative predictive value from 93% to 87%. Area under nonparametric receiver operating characteristic curve for peak lactate and CI was 0.78. CONCLUSION: Hyperlactatemia predicts CI during RCA-CVVH with reasonable discriminatory performance in critically ill patients.

However, no animal model has been developed for ARDS caused by infection with 2009 H1N1 virus. Here, we present a mouse model of ARDS induced by 2009 H1N1 virus. METHODOLOGY PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Mice were inoculated with A/swine/Shandong/731/2009 (SD/09), which was a 2009 H1N1 influenza variant with a G222D mutation in the hemagglutinin. Clinical symptoms were recorded every day. Lung injury was assessed by lung water content and histopathological observation. Arterial blood gas, leukocyte count in the bronchial alveolar lavage fluid and blood, virus titers, and cytokine levels in the lung were measured at various times post-inoculation. Mice infected with SD/09 virus showed typical ARDS symptoms characterized by 60% lethality on days 8–10 post-inoculation, highly edematous lungs, inflammatory cellular infiltration, alveolar and interstitial edema, lung hemorrhage, progressive and severe hypoxemia, and elevated levels of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines.

Serum albumin, high-density lipoprotein (HDL-C), and C-reactive protein have been known to be associated with the severity and mortality of community-acquired pneumonia. However, the characteristics and role of metabolic and inflammatory indicators in COVID-19 is unclear. MethodsWe included 97 hospitalized patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19. Epidemiological, clinical, and laboratory indices; radiological features; and treatment were analysed. The differences in the clinical and laboratory parameters between mild and severe COVID-19 patients and the role of these indicators in severity prediction of COVID-19 were investigated. ResultsAll were Wuhan residents with contact with confirmed COVID-19 cases. The median age was 39 years (IQR: 30-59). The most common presenting symptoms were fever (58.8%), cough (55.7%), and fatigue (33%). Other features were lymphopenia, impaired fasting glucose, hypoproteinaemia, hypoalbuminemia, low high-density lipoproteinemia. Decrease in lymphocyte count, serum total protein, serum albumin, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), ApoA1, CD3+T%, and CD8+T% were found to be valuable in predicting the transition of COVID-19 from mild to severe illness. Chest computed tomography (CT) images showed that the absorption of bilateral lung lesions synchronized with the recovery of metabolic and inflammatory indicators. ConclusionsHypoproteinaemia, hypoalbuminemia, low high-density lipoproteinemia, and decreased ApoA1, CD3+T%, and CD8+T% could predict severity of COVID-19. Lymphocyte count, total serum protein, and HDL-C may be potentially useful for the evaluation of COVID-19.",2020-03-26,"Nie, Shuke; Zhao, Xueqing; Zhao, Kang; Zhang, Zhaohui; Zhang, Zhentao; Zhang, Zhan",,,#20042283,,,,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.24.20042283,216421049.0

COVID-19 exhibits a more severe disease course in older, co-morbid adults. Awareness of atypical presentations is critical to facilitate early identification. OBJECTIVE: To assess how frailty affects presenting COVID-19 symptoms in older adults. DESIGN: Observational cohort study of hospitalised older patients and self-report data for community-based older adults. SETTING: Admissions to St Thomas' Hospital, London with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19. Community-based data for older adults using the COVID Symptom Study mobile application. SUBJECTS: Hospital cohort: patients aged 65 and over (n = 322); unscheduled hospital admission between March 1st, 2020-May 5th, 2020; COVID-19 confirmed by RT-PCR of nasopharyngeal swab. Community-based cohort: participants aged 65 and over enrolled in the COVID Symptom Study (n = 535); reported test-positive for COVID-19 from March 24th (application launch)-May 8th, 2020. METHODS: Multivariable logistic regression analysis performed on age-matched samples from hospital and community-based cohorts to ascertain association of frailty with symptoms of confirmed COVID-19. RESULTS: Hospital cohort: significantly higher prevalence of probable delirium in the frail sample, with no difference in fever or cough. Community-based cohort: significantly higher prevalence of possible delirium in frailer, older adults, and fatigue and shortness of breath. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first study demonstrating higher prevalence of probable delirium as a COVID-19 symptom in older adults with frailty compared to other older adults.

DESIGN: Cross-sectional analysis of an anonymous survey sent via text message link to personal cell phones and emails. SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: Nursing home and assisted living facility staff in Indiana. MEASURES: Staff characteristics including age, gender, race, ethnicity, role in the facility, experience in long-term care, and geographic location of facility were self-reported along with prior infection and willingness to receive an approved vaccine as soon as it is available. Responses were weighted to represent staff statewide. Weighted frequencies and logit regression estimated characteristics associated with vaccine willingness. RESULTS: There were 8,243 responses to the survey. For nursing home staff (survey delivered via 23,232 working phone numbers), there was a 33% response rate). There were 2,372 (29%) in nurse aide or similar roles and 1,602 nurses providing direct clinical care (19%). Overall, 45% of respondents indicated they would receive an approved COVID-19 vaccine as soon as available. Of those unwilling to take the vaccine when first available, 44% would consider in the future. Concerns about side effects was the primary reason for vaccine hesitancy (70%). Characteristics associated with increased willingness were age over 60, male, and white race (P < .0001). No statistically significant differences were observed among staff self-reporting prior SARS-CoV-2 infection. CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS: The willingness to receive the COVID-19 vaccine immediately or in the future may be as high as 69%, but varies among subgroups of nursing home staff which has implications for distribution. Educating staff on the vaccine may be critical for increasing uptake. Widespread vaccination holds the promise of protection against serious illness and death and a return of visitors and activities that support improved quality of life. This promise will not be realized without strong uptake of the vaccines.",2020,"Unroe, Kathleen T; Evans, Russell; Weaver, Lindsay; Rusyniak, Dan; Blackburn, Justin",J. am. geriatr. soc,,#999017,,,,,229713888.0

Seven (7) distinct yeasts were isolated and identified using cultural, microscopy and biochemical tests (temperature tolerance, flocculation, ethanol tolerance, H2S production and killer toxin production and the ability to assimilate and ferment sugars. The yeast isolates were screened using refractometric and spectrophotometric methods to select the isolate with the best ability for wine production. This isolate was molecularly characterized, grown in 1 L of potatoes dextrose broth, freeze dried and used for wine production. The population of yeast, bacteria and the physicochemical analysis of the must were monitored during fermentation. Populations of bacteria in the wine were assessed by standard pour plate count. The proximate content and physicochemical properties of the produced wine before and after ageing, as well as the sensorial quality of the produced wine was determined. All the yeast isolates possessed the ability to flocculate, tolerate ethanol concentration of between 5 and 20% and temperature range of 30-45 °C, produced low concentration of H2S and does not produce killer toxins. A palm wine isolate, identified as Saccharomyces cerevisiae X01 was selected as the best isolate with the most ability for wine production. The total yeast count increases as the period of fermentation progressed while the total viable bacterial count reduced as the fermentation period progressed. There was a significant difference (P < 0.05) in the physicochemical properties of the must during fermentation. At the end of the fermentation, the produced wine had 5.22% and 4.86% ethanol content for S. cerevisiae QA23 and S. cerevisiae X01 respectively.

METHODS: The semi-structured qualitative interviews were conducted virtually among purposively selected participants (n = 41) from both urban and rural areas in eight districts of Province 2 in Nepal. All the interviews were conducted in the local language between July and August 2020. The data analysis was performed using thematic network analysis in Nvivo 12 Pro software. RESULTS: The results of this study are grouped into four global themes: i) Impact of COVID-19 on food security; ii) Food insecurity and coping strategies during the COVID-19 pandemic, iii) Food relief and emergency support during the COVID-19 pandemic, and iv) Impact of COVID-19 and food insecurity on health and wellbeing. Most participants in the study expressed that families from low socioeconomic backgrounds and disadvantaged communities such as those working on daily wages and who rely on remittance had experienced increased food insecurity during the COVID-19 pandemic. Participants used different forms of coping strategies to meet their food requirements during the pandemic. Community members experienced favouritism, nepotism, and partiality from local politicians and authorities during the distribution of food relief. The food insecurity among low-income and disadvantaged families has affected their health and wellbeing making them increasingly vulnerable to the COVID-19 infection.

z3wujall,,WHO,Robust estimation of diagnostic rate and real incidence of COVID-19 for European policymakers,,,,unk,"Policymakers need clear, fast assessment of the real spread of the COVID-19 epidemic in each of their respective countries. Standard measures of the situation provided by the governments include reported positive cases and total deaths. While total deaths indicate immediately that countries like Italy and Spain had the worst situation as of mid-April, 2020, reported cases alone do not provide a complete picture of the situation. Different countries diagnose differently and present very distinctive reported case fatality ratios. Similar levels of reported incidence and mortality might hide a very different underlying pictures. Here we present a straightforward and robust estimation of the diagnostic rate in each European country. From that estimation we obtain a uniform, unbiased incidence of the epidemic. The method to obtain the diagnostic rate is transparent and empirical. The key assumption of the method is that the infection fatality ratio of COVID-19 in Europe is not strongly country-dependent. We show that this number is not expected to be biased due to demography nor to the way total deaths are reported. The estimation protocol is dynamic, and it has been yielding converging numbers for diagnostic rates in all European countries as from mid-April, 2020. Using this diagnostic rate, policy makers can obtain Effective Potential Growth updated every day, providing an unbiased assessment of the countries at greater risk of experiencing an uncontrolled situation. The method developed has been and will be used to track possible improvements in the diagnostic rate in European countries as the epidemic evolves.",2021,"Català, Martí; Pino, David; Marchena, Miquel; Palacios, Pablo; Urdiales, Tomás; Cardona, Pere-Joan; Alonso, Sergio; López-Codina, David; Prats, Clara; Alvarez-Lacalle, Enrique",PLoS One,,#1060187,,,,,218503785.0

wenliby6,,WHO,"Inflammation: A bridge between diabetes and COVID-19, and possible management with sitagliptin",,,,unk,"Patients with SARS-CoV-2 infections experience lymphopenia and inflammatory cytokine storms in the severe stage of the disease, leading to multi-organ damage. The exact pattern of immune system changes and their condition during the disease process is unclear. The available knowledge has indicated that the NF-kappa-B pathway, which is induced by several mediators, has a significant role in cytokine storm through the various mechanisms. Therefore, identifying the state of the immune cells and the dominant mechanisms for the production of cytokines incorporated in the cytokine storm can be a critical step in the therapeutic approach. On the other hand, some studies identified a higher risk for diabetic patients. Diabetes mellitus exhibits a close association with inflammation and increases the chance of developing COVID-19. Patients with diabetes mellitus have shown to have more virus entry, impaired immunity response, less viral elimination, and dysregulated inflammatory cytokines. The parallel analysis of COVID-19 and diabetes mellitus pathogenesis has proposed that the control of the inflammation through the interfering with the critical points of major signaling pathways may provide the new therapeutic approaches. In recent years, the role of Dipeptidyl Peptidase 4 (DPP4) in chronic inflammation has been proved. Numerous immune cells express the DPP4 protein. DPP4 regulates antibody production, cytokine secretion, and immunoglobulin class switching. DPP4 inhibitors like sitagliptin reduce inflammation intensity in different states. Following the accumulating data, we hypothesize that sitagliptin might reduce COVID-19 severity. Sitagliptin, an available DPP4 inhibitor drug, showed multidimensional anti-inflammatory effects among diabetic patients. It reduces the inflammation mostly by affecting on NF-kappa-B signaling pathway.

As the COVID-19 pandemic began to sweep across the US it elicited a wide spectrum of responses, both online and offline, across the population. Here, we analyze around 13 million geotagged tweets in 49 cities across the US from the first few months of the pandemic to assess regional dependence in online sentiments with respect to a few major COVID-19 related topics, and how these sentiments correlate with policy development and human mobility. In this study, we observe universal trends in overall and topic-based sentiments across cities over the time period studied. We also find that this online geolocalized emotion is significantly impacted by key COVID-19 policy events. However, there is significant variation in the emotional responses to these policies across the cities studied. Online emotional responses are also found to be a good indicator for predicting offline local mobility, while the correlations between these emotional responses and local cases and deaths are relatively weak.

The highest keratinase activity was obtained at 40–45 °C, pH 8–9, feather concentration 0.5–1%, and using white chicken feather as keratin substrate for 72 h. Enhancement of keratinase activity through physical mutagen UV radiation and/or chemical mutagen ethyl methanesulfonate (EMS) resulted in five mutants with 1.51–3.73-fold increased activity over the wild type. When compared with the wild type, scanning electron microscopy validated the mutants’ effectiveness in feather degradation. Bacterial isolates are classified as members of the S8 family peptidase Bacillus cereus group based on sequence analysis of the 16S rRNA and keratinase genes. Interestingly, keratinase KerS gene shared 95.5–100% identity to keratinase, thermitase alkaline serine protease, and thermophilic serine protease of the B. cereus group. D(137)N substitution was observed in the keratinase KerS gene of the mutant strain S13 (KerS13uv+ems), and also seven substitution variations in KerS26 and KerS26uv of strain S26 and its mutant S26uv. Functional analysis revealed that the subtilisin-like serine protease domain containing the Asp/His/Ser catalytic triad of KerS gene was not affected by the predicted substitutions. Prediction of physicochemical properties of KerS gene showed instability index between 17.5–19.3 and aliphatic index between 74.7–75.7, which imply keratinase stability and significant thermostability. The docking studies revealed the impact of substitutions on the superimposed structure and an increase in binding of mutant D(137)N of KerS13uv+ems (affinity: −7.17; S score: −6.54 kcal/mol) and seven mutants of KerS26uv (affinity: −7.43; S score: −7.17 kcal/mol) compared to the wild predicted structure (affinity: −6.57; S score: −6.68 kcal/mol). Together, the keratinolytic activity, similarity to thermostable keratinases, and binding affinity suggest that keratinases KerS13uv+ems and KerS26uv could be used for feather processing in the industry.",2022-01-01,"Almahasheer, Arwa Ali; Mahmoud, Amal; El-Komy, Hesham; Alqosaibi, Amany I.; Aktar, Sultan; AbdulAzeez, Sayed; Borgio, J.

The severe acute respiratory syndrome virus (SARS-COV-2) was found at very high concentrations in swab and sputum of such cases. Objective: We aimed to estimate virus release from such cases into different aerosol sizes by normal breathing and coughing, and what exposure can result from this in a room shared with such as case. Data Sources and Model: We combined the size-distribution of exhaled breath aerosols for coughing and normal breathing with viral sputum concentrations as approximation for lung lining liquid to obtain an estimate of emitted virus levels. The resulting emission data fed a single-compartment model of airborne concentrations in a room of 50m3, the size of a small office or medical exam room. Results: The estimated viral load in aerosols emitted by patients while breathing normally was on average 0.34 copies/cm3 and could go up to 11.5 copies/cm3. The corresponding numbers for coughing patients were 10,900 copies/cm3 and 366,000 copies/cm3, respectively, per cough. The resulting concentrations in a room with a coughing emitter were always very high, up to 2.02*10^9 copies/m3. However, also regular breathing aerosol from high emitters was predicted to lead to several thousand copies/m3. Conclusions and Relevance: These very high predicted virus concentrations may provide an explanation why for COVID-19, frequent community transmissions from non-symptomatic cases and also high infection rates in medical staff in hospital settings were reported.

The scale of patients now being cared for in hospital-at-home settings as a result of COVID19 places huge pressure on hospital central sterile services departments (CSSDs) to provide consumable items to safely support such patients’ care. This places new importance on the disinfection of mundane objects, including crockery, cutlery and frequently touched objects in the home environment. This study examined temperature performance of steam disinfectors and the consequences of potential operator misuse on the survival of 62 bacteria and yeast organisms. METHODS: Thermal performance of steam disinfectors was evaluated using calibrated thermocouple probes in multiple permutations of device usage with 62 test organisms. RESULTS: Thermocouple data demonstrated disinfection A(0) values of 6000 (upper layer) and 60 (lower layer). Steam disinfection of baby bottles had a thermal lethality of at least A(0) = 600. Variation in disinfector temperatures were noted, depending on the geometric location of thermocouples. Additional notable temperature reductions occurred with device underfilling with suboptimal water volumes. Steam disinfection eradicated all 62 non-spore-forming Gram-positive, Gram-negative and yeast organisms tested and eradicated all organisms in the inner teat space of contaminated babies' dummies, rendering safe steam disinfection of babies’ dummies. CONCLUSION: Domestic steam disinfection offers an inexpensive, simple, versatile and widely available technology for the elimination of common non-spore-forming nosocomial pathogens and safe disinfection of medical devices, fomites and other mundane objects within the hospital-at-home scenario, thereby enhancing patient safety.",2020-10-15,"Millar, Beverley C.; Stirling, Jonathan; Maguire, Mollie; Moore, Rachel E.; Murphy, Alan; Moore, John E.",Infect Dis Health,,,,document_parses/pdf_json/ee446617804fea76a962a1c618212dd1833bf161.json,document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7560255.xml.json,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2468045120300687; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2468045120300687; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.idh.2020.09.005; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33071208/,222410252.0

Introduction: Different psychological symptoms of distress as well as drinking motives have been associated with alcohol use in college students. The COVID-19 lockdown [aislamiento social, preventivo y obligatorio (ASPO)] reduced movement to a minimum, impacting college students’ mental health and generating changes in several behaviours, including alcohol use. Objectives: To examine the association between symptoms of anxiety, depression and stress, drinking motives and alcohol use in two groups of Argentinian college students, before and during the first three months of lockdown. In addition, it was examined whether drinking motives mediate the relationship between psychological distress and alcohol use. Methods: Two samples of college students, one before the lockdown (n=125; mean age, 23.87 ± 3.27 years; 73.6% women) and another during the lockdown (n=174; 24.32 ± 3.64 years; 78.2% women) completed an online survey. Results: Alcohol use, as well as social and enhancement motives, decreased in college students during lockdown. The associations between psychological distress and drinking motives with alcohol use were more consistent in the group during lockdown compared with the group after lockdown. At a multivariate level, coping motives explained an increased frequency of alcohol consumption in college students during lockdown.

The disease led to significant mortality and morbidity in Turkey, since the first case was reported on March 11th, 2020. Studies suggest a positive association between air pollution and SARS-CoV-2 infection. The aim of the present study was to investigate the role of ambient particulate matters (PM), as potential carriers for SARS-CoV-2. Ambient PM samples in various size ranges were collected from 13 sites including urban and urban-background locations and hospital gardens in 10 cities across Turkey between 13th of May and 14th of June 2020 to investigate the possible presence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA on ambient PM. A total of 203 daily samples (TSP, n = 80; PM2.5, n = 33; PM2.5-10, n = 23; PM10µm, n = 19; and 6 size segregated PM, n = 48) were collected using various samplers. The N1 gene and RdRP gene expressions were analyzed for the presence of SARS-CoV-2, as suggested by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). According to real time (RT)-PCR and three-dimensional (3D) digital (d) PCR analysis, dual RdRP and N1 gene positivity were detected in 20 (9.8%) samples. Ambient PM-bound SARS-CoV-2 was analyzed quantitatively and the air concentrations of the virus ranged from 0.1 copies/m3 to 23 copies/m3. The highest percentages of virus detection on PM samples were from hospital gardens in Tekirdag, Zonguldak, and Istanbul, especially in PM2.5 mode. Findings of this study have suggested that SARS-CoV-2 may be transported by ambient particles, especially at sites close to the infection hot-spots.

However, the role of IBV as an enteric pathogen in still controversial. In Brazil, antigenic groups of IBV divergent from the Massachusetts serotype used for vaccination schedules in that country have already been demonstrated. The present study aimed to assess the different genotypes of IBV in Brazilian commercial poultry flocks by partial sequencing of the S1 amino-terminus coding region using enteric contents as samples and examine their relationship with the vaccine serotype currently in use. Samples of enteric contents were taken as pools of five birds from each of 18 poultry farms (17 broiler and one laying farm) from five Brazilian states between 2002 and 2006. Birds were presenting watery diarrhea and poor general condition but were without respiratory, renal, or reproductive signs. Conventional antibacterial and anticoccidial therapies were unsuccessful and, furthermore, all samples proved negative for rotavirus, reovirus, and astrovirus. Eleven IBV samples were isolated in embryonated eggs and resulted in S1 sequences. Phylogenetic analysis showed that these segregated into an exclusive cluster, close to serotype D274, but distant from Massachusetts. Mean amino acid identity amongst these Brazilian strains was 94.07%; amongst these and serotypes D274, 4/91, and Massachusetts, mean amino acid identity was 77.17%, 69.94%, and 68.93%, respectively. In conclusion, the presence of genotype variant strains of IBV in Brazilian poultry flocks has been demonstrated and might be the reason for the unsuccessful control of IBV in Brazil.

Here, we evaluate the changes in nationwide use of broad-spectrum antibiotics during the COVID-19 epidemic in South Korea. METHODS: We obtained national reimbursement data on the prescription of antibiotics, including penicillin with beta-lactamase inhibitors, cephalosporins, fluoroquinolones, and macrolides. We examined the number of antibiotic prescriptions compared with the previous three years in the same period from August to July. To quantify the impact of the COVID-19 epidemic on antibiotic use, we developed a regression model adjusting for changes of viral acute respiratory tract infections (ARTIs) which are an important factor driving antibiotic use. RESULTS: During the COVID-19 epidemic in South Korea, the broad-spectrum antibiotic use dropped by 15%-55% compared to the previous 3 years. Overall reduction in antibiotic use adjusting for ARTIs was estimated to be 14%-30%, with a larger impact in children. CONCLUSIONS: Our study found that broad-spectrum antibiotic use was substantially reduced during the COVID-19 epidemic in South Korea. This reduction can be in part due to reduced ARTIs as a result of stringent public health interventions including social distancing measures.",2021,"Ryu, Sukhyun; Hwang, Youngsik; Ali, Sheikh Taslim; Kim, Dong-Sook; Klein, Eili Y; Lau, Eric H Y; Cowling, Benjamin J",J. infect. dis,,#1185676,,,,,233242966.0

As expected, it is useful to achieve state-of-the-art performance on various datasets. However, these local learned descriptors suffer from the inconsistency problem without considering the relationship between two descriptors in a patch. Consequently, the problem causes the irregular spatial distribution of local learned descriptors. In this paper, we propose a neat method to overcome the above inconsistency problem. The core idea is to design a triplet loss function of vertex-edge constraint (VEC), which takes the correlation between two descriptors of a patch into account. Furthermore, to minimize the non-matching descriptors’ influence, we propose an exponential algorithm to reduce the difference between the long and short sides.

Instead of attributing these developments to technological ingenuity, this article argues for the primacy of material encounters as a promising focal point of medical historiography. In fact, blood's special properties consistently clashed with most materials used in medical practice, provoking a series of material exchanges. Drawing on a combination of epistemological and network approaches, three exemplary cases are presented to examine blood's encounters with plastics, plant and animal extracts: William M. Bayliss's (1860-1926) injections of dissolved gum acacia to expand diminished blood volume; Charles H. Best's (1899-1978) production of the anticoagulant heparin from animal organs; and the preservation of fragile blood cells by silicone coatings inside of John H. Gibbon Jr.'s (1903-1973) heart-lung machine. The case studies demonstrate how the complementarity of blood and these materials produced hybridizations between medicine and a range of industrial branches, from colonial forestry and meatpacking to commercial chemistry.

A total of 210 patients, aged between 60 and 98 years were included in the study cohort. MEASUREMENTS: International Severe Acute Respiratory Infection Consortium Clinical Characterization Protocol-Coronavirus Clinical Characterization Consortium (ISARIC-4C) score, COVID-GRAM Critical Illness Risk Score (COVID-GRAM), quick COVID-19 Severity Index (qCSI), National Early Warning Score (NEWS). RESULTS: Median age was 74 (67-82) and 133 (63.3%) were males. Globally, 42 patients (20.0%) deceased. All the score evaluated showed a fairly good predictive value with respect to in-hospital death. The ISARIC-4C score had the highest area under ROC curve (AUROC) 0.799 (0.738-0.851), followed by the COVID-GRAM 0.785 (0.723-0.838), NEWS 0.764 (0.700-0.819), and qCSI 0.749 (0.685-0.806). However, these differences were not statistical significant. CONCLUSION: Among the evaluated scores, the ISARIC-4C and the COVID-GRAM, calculated at ED admission, had the best performance, although the qCSI had similar efficacy by evaluating only three items. However, the NEWS, already widely validated in clinical practice, had a similar performance and could be appropriate for older patients with COVID-19.",2020,"Covino, Marcello; De Matteis, Giuseppe; Burzo, Maria Livia; Russo, Andrea; Forte, Evelina; Carnicelli, Annamaria; Piccioni, Andrea; Simeoni, Benedetta; Gasbarrini, Antonio; Franceschi, Francesco; Sandroni, Claudio",,,#944746,,,,,226989285.0

PCV3 replication involves the entry of the viral capsid (Cap) protein with nucleolar localization signals into the nucleus. Using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry analysis, nucleolar phosphoprotein NPM1 was identified as one of the cellular proteins bound to PCV3 Cap. Co-immunoprecipitation demonstrated that PCV3 Cap interacts directly with NPM1, where the region binding with NPM1 is mapped to amino acid residues 1–38 of Cap. Upon co-transfection, the expression of Cap protein promoted the redistribution of NPM1, which translocated from the nucleus to the cytoplasm and colocalized with Cap in cultured PK15 cells. NPM1 expression was upregulated and translocated from the nucleus to the cytoplasm in PCV3-infected cells, upon siRNA-mediated depletion, or upon treatment with NPM1 inhibitor in PK15 cells with impaired PCV3 replication, as evidenced by decreased levels of viral DNA synthesis and protein expression. By contrast, the replication of PCV3 was enhanced in stably NPM1-expressing cells via a lentivirus-delivered system. Taken together, these findings indicate that NPM1 interacts with PCV3 Cap and plays a crucial role in PCV3 replication.",2021-05-25,"Song, Jiangwei; Hou, Lei; Wang, Dan; Wei, Li; Zhu, Shanshan; Wang, Jing; Quan, Rong; Jiang, Haijun; Shi, Ruihan; Liu, Jue",Front Microbiol,,,,document_parses/pdf_json/2e5eb19f7a6c706770992a855e7e9a6bcb3920e0.json,document_parses/pmc_json/PMC8185148.xml.json,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8185148/,

The question is what is the fate of the infected cells? All eukaryotic cells can “sense” viral infections and exhibit defence strategies to oppose viral replication and spread. This often leads to the elimination of the infected cells by programmed cell death or apoptosis. This “sacrifice” of infected cells represents the most primordial response of multicellular organisms to viruses. Subverting host cell apoptosis, at least for some time, is therefore a crucial strategy of viruses to ensure their replication, the production of essential viral proteins, virus assembly and the spreading to new hosts. For that reason many viruses harbor apoptosis inhibitory genes, which once inside infected cells are expressed to circumvent apoptosis induction during the virus reproduction phase. On the other hand, viruses can take advantage of stimulating apoptosis to (i) facilitate shedding and hence dissemination, (ii) to prevent infected cells from presenting viral antigens to the immune system or (iii) to kill non-infected bystander and immune cells which would limit viral propagation. Hence the decision whether an infected host cell undergoes apoptosis or not depends on virus type and pathogenicity, its capacity to oppose antiviral responses of the infected cells and/or to evade any attack from immune cells. Viral genomes have therefore been adapted throughout evolution to satisfy the need of a particular virus to induce or inhibit apoptosis during its life cycle. Here we review the different strategies used by viruses to interfere with the two major apoptosis as well as with the innate immune signaling pathways in mammalian cells. We will focus on the intrinsic mitochondrial pathway and discuss new ideas about how particular viruses could activately engage mitochondria to induce apoptosis of their host.",2015-11-02,"Neumann, Simon; El Maadidi, Souhayla; Faletti, Laura; Haun, Florian; Labib, Shirin; Schejtman, Andrea; Maurer, Ulrich; Borner, Christoph",Virus Res,,,,document_parses/pdf_json/450a221c1528cca41fb907e93230576803afb369.json,document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7114537.xml.json,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.virusres.2015.02.026; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25736565/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0168170215001161; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0168170215001161,37329488.0

Our experience at a third-level university hospital,,,,unk,"BACKGROUND: 3D printing and distributed manufacturing represent a paradigm shift in the health system that is becoming critical during the COVID-19 pandemic. University hospitals are also taking on the role of manufacturers of custom-made solutions thanks to 3D printing technology. CASE PRESENTATION: We present a monocentric observational case study regarding the distributed manufacturing of three groups of products during the period of the COVID-19 pandemic from 14 March to 10 May 2020: personal protective equipment, ventilatory support, and diagnostic and consumable products. Networking during this period has enabled the delivery of a total of 17,276 units of products manufactured using 3D printing technology. The most manufactured product was the face shields and ear savers, while the one that achieved the greatest clinical impact was the mechanical ventilation adapters and swabs. The products were manufactured by individuals in 57.3% of the cases, and our hospital acted as the main delivery node in a hub with 10 other hospitals. The main advantage of this production model is the fast response to stock needs, being able to adapt almost in real time. CONCLUSIONS: The role of 3D printing in the hospital environment allows the reconciliation of in-house and distributed manufacturing with traditional production, providing custom-made adaptation of the specifications, as well as maximum efficiency in the working and availability of resources, which is of special importance at critical times for health systems such as the current COVID-19 pandemic.",2021,"Perez-Mañanes, Rubén; José, Sonia García-de San; Desco-Menéndez, Manuel; Sánchez-Arcilla, Ignacio; González-Fernández, Esmeralda; Vaquero-Martín, Javier; González-Garzón, Javier Pascau; Mediavilla-Santos, Lydia; Trapero-Moreno, Diego; Calvo-Haro, José Antonio",3D Print Med,,#covidwho-1120068,,,,,232137377.0

METHODS: A deep literature search was performed in the databases through August 21, 2020. Risk ratio (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were pooled using analysis models. RESULTS: Three studies including 2046 infected patients were precisely evaluated, and the results show that the elderly group has a higher risk of hypertension, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease than the younger patients. Their total white blood cells are higher than that of the younger patients, and their lymphocytes are relatively reduced compared with the younger patients. CONCLUSION: We comprehensively assessed the clinical characteristics of patients of different ages with COVID-19 and found that elder patients had a high risk of chronic cardiovascular and metabolism comorbidities. The characteristic clinical manifestations and laboratory examinations of elderly patients support their excessive inflammation and weak immune defenses against 2019-nCoV.

Here, we consider how COVID-induced job search anxiety-feeling anxious about one's job search due to issues imposed by the pandemic-has the potential to affect adaptive, goal-directed efforts, and maladaptive, goal-avoidant reactions. We theorize that this anxiety can prompt job seekers to engage in problem-solving pondering and affect-focused rumination, with these experiences relating to whether job seekers engage in various forms of search-related efforts the following week. In particular, we consider whether job seekers are engaging in dream job search effort (i.e., effort toward pursuing one's dream job), as well as focused (i.e., effort toward a selection of carefully screened jobs), exploratory (i.e., effort toward a wide swath of jobs in a broad manner), and haphazard (i.e., effort toward applying for any job without a clear plan) job search effort. Further, we consider how stable beliefs relevant to the pandemic (i.e., belief in conspiracy theories; belief in COVID-19 being a public health crisis) affect the aforementioned relationships. Using a weekly study of 162 new labor market entrants, results indicated that COVID-induced job search anxiety positively related to problem-solving pondering and affect-focused rumination; problem-solving pondering promoted dream, focused, and exploratory job search effort the following week, whereas affect-focused rumination hindered dream job search effort. Finally, the detrimental effects of COVID-induced job search anxiety via affect-focused rumination were amplified for those who held higher levels of conspiracy theory beliefs.

DESIGN: Retrospective consecutive case series. PARTICIPANTS: One hundred and ninety eyes of 188 patients with primary, rhegmatogenous RD. METHODS: Patients with RD who presented over a 1-year period (September 14, 2019 to September 13, 2020). The relationship between demographic, anatomic, and visual acuity parameters were compared before and after onset of the pandemic using generalized estimating equations. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Macular status and corrected distance visual acuity on presentation. RESULTS: One hundred and eighty-seven eyes, divided into 2 cohorts: pre-COVID (nâ¯=â¯100 September 14, 2019 to March 13, 2020) and post-COVID (nâ¯=â¯87, March 14, 2020 to September 13, 2020). Of the eyes, 63.2% (nâ¯=â¯87) presented with macular detachment in the post-COVID group compared with 45% (nâ¯=â¯100) in the pre-COVID group (odds ration [OR], 2.14; 95% confidence interval [CI],1.19-3.86; pâ¯=â¯0.011). As well, eyes in the pre-pandemic cohort had significantly fewer detached quadrants on initial examination (OR, 0.53; 95% CI, 0.30-0.93; pâ¯=â¯0.026). Patients in the post-COVID group had a significantly worse corrected distance visual acuity at baseline (mean difference [MD]â¯=â¯-0.35 logMAR, 95% CI, -0.60 to -0.09; pâ¯=â¯0.008), but not at 1 month or at final follow-up.

We evaluated the safety and effectiveness data from five participating US centers. METHODS Records of patients with ruptured cerebral aneurysms who underwent PED treatment between 2011 and 2013 were retrospectively reviewed. RESULTS 26 patients with ruptured aneurysms underwent PED treatment (mean age 51.4 ± 13.2 years;16 women). At presentation, 8 patients (30.8%) had a Hunt-Hess grade of IV or above; 11 required extraventricular drain placement. Aneurysm morphologies were: 8 dissecting, 8 blister-like, 6 fusiform, and 4 saccular. There were 22 anterior circulation and 4 posterior circulation aneurysms. PED deployment was successful in all patients, with adjunctive coiling utilized in 12. Periprocedural complications occurred in 5 (19.2%), including 3 inhospital deaths. 23 patients (88.5%) had postoperative angiography at a mean of 5.9 months: 18 aneurysms (78.3%) were completely occluded, 3 (13.0%) had residual neck filling, and 2 (8.7%) had residual dome filling.

kuqimkp5,,WHO,Guiding equitable prioritisation of COVID-19 vaccine distribution and strategic deployment in South Africa to enhance effectiveness and access to vulnerable communities and prevent waste,,,,unk,"BACKGROUND: In South Africa (SA), >2.4 million cases of COVID-19 and >72 000 deaths were recorded between March 2020 and 1 August 2021, affecting the country's 52 districts to various extents. SA has committed to a COVID-19 vaccine roll-out in three phases, prioritising frontline workers, the elderly, people with comorbidities and essential workers. However, additional actions will be necessary to support efficient allocation and equitable access for vulnerable, access-constrained communities. OBJECTIVES: To explore various determinants of disease severity, resurgence risk and accessibility in order to aid an equitable, effective vaccine roll-out for SA that would maximise COVID-19 epidemic control by reducing the number of COVID-19 transmissions and resultant deaths, while at the same time reducing the risk of vaccine wastage. METHODS: For the 52 districts of SA, 26 COVID-19 indicators such as hospital admissions, deaths in hospital and mobility were ranked and hierarchically clustered with cases to identify which indicators can be used as indicators for severity or resurgence risk. Districts were then ranked using the estimated COVID-19 severity and resurgence risk to assist with prioritisation of vaccine roll-out. Urban and rural accessibility were also explored as factors that could limit vaccine roll-out in hard-to-reach communities. RESULTS: Highly populated urban districts showed the most cases. Districts such as Buffalo City, City of Cape Town and Nelson Mandela Bay experienced very severe first and second waves of the pandemic. Districts with high mobility, population size and density were found to be at highest risk of resurgence. In terms of accessibility, we found that 47.2% of the population are within 5 km of a hospital with >=50 beds, and this percentage ranged from 87.0% in City of Cape Town to 0% in Namakwa district. CONCLUSIONS: The end goal is to provide equal distribution of vaccines proportional to district populations, which will provide fair protection. Districts with a high risk of resurgence and severity should be prioritised for vaccine roll-out, particularly the major metropolitan areas. We provide recommendations for allocations of different vaccine types for each district that consider levels of access, numbers of doses and cold-chain storage capability.",2022,"Ovens, W.; Tomescu, S.; Harrison, E.; Crampton, T.; De Nooy, A.; Jassat, W.; Banoo, S.; Pisa, P.; Sanne, I.",South African Medical Journal,,#covidwho-1679055,,,,,246517395.0

The main 3-chymotrypsin-like cysteine protease (3CLPro ) enzyme of SARS-CoV-2, which operates its replication, could be used as a medication discovery point. We therefore theoretically studied and docked the effects of 19 hydrolysable tannins on SARS-CoV-2 by assembling with the catalytic dyad residues of its 3CLpro using molecular operating environment (MOE 09). Results discovered that pedunculagin, tercatain, and castalin intensely interacted with the receptor binding site and catalytic dyad (Cys145 and His41) of SARS-CoV-2. Our analyses estimated that the top three hits might serve as potential inhibitor of SARS-CoV-2 leading molecules for additional optimization and drug development process to combat COVID-19. This study unleashed that tannins with specific structure could be utilized as natural inhibitors against COVID-19. PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS: The 3CLPro controls SARS-CoV-2 copying and manages its life series, which was targeted in case of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV coronavirus. About 19 hydrolysable tannins were computed against 3CLpro of SARS-CoV-2. Pedunculagin, tercatain, and castalin interacted with Cys145 and His41 of SARS-CoV-2-3CLpro .

In order to use digital technologies, employees need to acquire new knowledge and skills. The aim of this research study is to perform an analysis of the development of digital transformation and relevant competencies for employees and to identify the opportunities and challenges in Latvia. The research methodology applied for this research study is based on examining relevant theoretical concepts and publications of the EU regarding digital transformation. A survey method was used to find out the opinions of Latvian employers regarding the importance of digital transformation and relevant competencies for employees. The analysis of the research indicated that the majority of the respondents surveyed rated the level of implementation of digital transformation as high or medium-high, which shows that this is a good trend, and the digitalization process continues to progress. However, about a third of enterprises are only at the early stage of digitalization, while some have not yet begun it. The problem is the development of human capital competencies and digital skills.

Psychological treatment of loneliness can be effective, but the evidence base is limited. OBJECTIVE To investigate the efficacy of 2 internet-based interventions based on cognitive behavioral therapy (ICBT) and interpersonal psychotherapy (IIPT) relative to a wait-list control group and each other. METHODS A total of 170 participants were recruited and randomized to either 9 weeks of ICBT (n = 68), IIPT (n = 68), or a wait-list condition (n = 34). The primary outcome was loneliness, measured using the UCLA Loneliness Scale before, during, and after treatment. Secondary measures of psychiatric disorders and quality of life were administered before and after treatment. Follow-up was conducted 4 months after the treatment had ended. Primary outcome data were analyzed using growth curve modeling. Secondary outcomes were analyzed using robust regression models. The trial was preregistered (ClinicalTrials.gov ID: NCT03807154). RESULTS The ICBT condition had a significantly greater impact on loneliness compared to the wait-list and IIPT conditions. Effect sizes were moderate to large (Cohen d = 0.71) compared to the wait-list and moderate (d = 0.53) compared to IIPT. The IIPT condition did not differ significantly from the wait-list. Both active treatments led to significant increases in quality of life. Only the ICBT group had significantly lower symptoms of depression and generalized anxiety compared to the wait-list group. Treatment gains were maintained but not improved at follow-up. CONCLUSIONS ICBT can be an efficacious option for alleviating loneliness.

This disease has a multifactorial origin and it is associated with multiple comorbidities including type 2 diabetes, hypertension, osteoarthritis, metabolic syndrome, cancer, and dyslipidemia. With regard to dyslipidemia, hypertriglyceridemia is a well-known activator of the NLRP3 inflammasome, triggering adipokines and cytokines secretion which in addition induce a systemic inflammatory state that provides an adequate scenario for infections, particularly those mediated by viruses such as HIV, H1N1 influenza, and SARS-CoV-2. The SARS-CoV-2 infection causes the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and it is responsible for the pandemic that we are currently living. COVID-19 causes an aggressive immune response known as cytokine release syndrome or cytokine storm that causes multiorgan failure and in most cases leads to death. In the present work, we aimed to review the molecular mechanisms by which obesity-associated systemic inflammation could cause a more severe clinical presentation of COVID-19. The SARS-CoV-2 infection could potentiate or accelerate the pre-existing systemic inflammatory state of individuals with obesity, via the NLRP3 inflammasome activation and the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines from cells trough Gasdermin-pores commonly found in cell death by pyroptosis.",2020,"López-Reyes, Alberto; Martinez-Armenta, Carlos; Espinosa-Velázquez, Rocio; Vázquez-Cárdenas, Paola; Cruz-Ramos, Marlid; Palacios-Gonzalez, Berenice; Gomez-Quiroz, Luis Enrique; Martínez-Nava, Gabriela Angélica",Front Immunol,,#976246,,,,,226080232.0

The prevalence of FH varies between countries because of founder effects, use of different diagnostic criteria, and screening strategies. However, little is known about differences in FH prevalence according to ethnicity. We aimed to investigate the ethnic distribution of FH in diverse populations and estimate the prevalence of FH according to ethnicity. Methods: We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis, searching PubMed and Web of Science for studies presenting data on the prevalence of heterozygous FH among different ethnicities in non-founder populations. Studies with more than 100 individuals, relevant data on prevalence, ethnicity, and using the Dutch Lipid Clinical Network Criteria, Simon Broome, Making Early Diagnosis Prevents Early Death, genetic screening, or comparable diagnostic criteria were considered eligible for inclusion. Results: Eleven general population studies and two patient studies were included in a systematic review and 11 general population studies in a random-effects meta-analysis. The overall pooled FH prevalence was 0.33% or 1:303 in 1,169,879 individuals (95% confidence interval: 0.26-0:40%; 1:385-1:250). Included studies presented data on six ethnicities: black, Latino, white, Asian, brown, and mixed/other. Pooled prevalence was estimated for each group. The highest prevalence observed was 0.52% or 1:192 among blacks (0.34-0.69%; 1:294-1:145) and 0.48% or 1:208 among browns (0.31-0.74%; 1:323-1:135) while the lowest pooled prevalence was 0.25% or 1:400 among Asians (0.15-0.35; 1:500-1:286). The prevalence was 0.37% or 1:270 among Latino (0.24-0.69%; 1:417-1:145), 0.31% or 1:323 among white (0.24-0.41%; 1:417-1:244), and 0.32% or 1:313 among mixed/other individuals (0.13-0.52%; 1:769-1:192). Conclusion: The estimated FH prevalence displays a variation across ethnicity, ranging from 0.25% (1:400) to 0.52% (1:192), with the highest prevalence seen among the black and brown and the lowest among the Asian individuals.

It was observed that only 64% (urban) and 73% (suburban) were aware of dentistry with a slight increase in student’s choice for traditional medicine courses over allopathic medicine (40% urban, 48% suburban) post pandemic. Within the limitations of this study it is evident that school students are less aware of various dentistry courses, and access to training for the exams can motivate the number of students seeking admission to dentistry courses.",2021,"Bettie, N.

Additionally, the human Inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase (IMPDH) was targeted by the same inhibitors. The results reveal a comparable binding affinity of four nucleotide derivatives compared to remdesivir and sofosbuvir against both IMPDH and the RdRps of SARS-CoV-2 and Rhizopus oryzae , the main causing agent of mucormycosis. The binding affinities are calculated using different conformations of the RdRps after 100 ns MDS and trajectories clustering.

This study was designed to explore the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on patients who underwent percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). METHODS: From January 2019 to December 2020, 489,001 patients from 1068 institutions were registered in the Japanese nationwide PCI (J-PCI) registry. We constructed generalized linear models to assess the difference in the daily number of patients and in-hospital outcomes between 2019 and 2020. FINDINGS: In total, 207 institutions (19·3%) had closed or restricted access during the first COVID-19 outbreak in May 2020; the number of closed or restricted institutions had plateaued at a median of 121 institutions (11·3%). The daily case volume of PCI significantly decreased in 2020 (by 6·7% compared with that in 2019; 95% confidence interval [CI], 6·2–7·2%; p < 0·001). Marked differences in the presentation of PCI patients were observed; more patients presented with ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (18·3% vs. 17·5%; p < 0·001), acute heart failure (4·49% vs. 4·30%; p = 0·001), cardiogenic shock (3·79% vs. 3·45%; p < 0·001), and cardiopulmonary arrest (2·12% vs. 2·00%; p = 0·002) in 2020. The excess adjusted in-hospital mortality rate in patients treated in 2020 relative to those treated in 2019 was significant (adjusted odds ratio, 1·054; 95% CI, 1·004–1·107; p = 0·03). INTERPRETATION: While the number of patients who underwent PCI substantially decreased during the COVID-19 pandemic, more patients presented with high-risk characteristics and were associated with significantly higher adjusted in-hospital mortality.

This study had the participation of 39 students from the second semester “A” of Pedagogía de los Idiomas Nacionales y Extranjeros program at Technical University of Ambato. The whole experimental group (EG) was allowed to use online resources such as stories taken from The Moth web page to practice and complete some speaking tasks. To assess the speaking skill, a mock-up Key English Test (KET) speaking part was used as a pre and post-test. The speaking criteria were stated in the rubric provided by Cambridge which consisted of Grammar and Vocabulary, Pronunciation and Interactive Communication. The experiment was designed with the use of with the use of online stories according to student’s age and needs and obviously taking into consideration the COVID-19 pandemic. In order to analyze the experimental data that were represented in the paper, the SPSS program was used to apply a T-Student test. To conclude, the results showed that online stories taken from The Moth web page had positive effects on the development of the students’ speaking skill.

We aimed to investigate COVID-19 risk in people with asthma. METHODS: We used UK Biobank data from all participants tested for SARS-CoV-2 (n=107 412 (17 979 test positive)). Baseline questions at baseline defined ever asthma and asthma medications. Baseline Forced Expiratory Volume in the first second (FEV(1)) was categorized into quartiles. Logistic regression modelled relationships between asthma, and asthma categories (age at onset, medications, FEV(1) quartiles), and risk of SARS-CoV-2 positive test. We investigated modification by sex, ethnic group, smoking, and BMI. RESULTS: There was a reduced risk of a positive test associated with with early-onset asthma (<13 years), (OR 0.91(95% CI 0.84, 0.99). This was found for early-onset asthmatics in males (OR 0·87 [95% CI: 0·78, 0·98]), non-smokers (0·87 [0·78, 0·98]), overweight/obese (0.85 [0.77, 0.93]), and non-Black participants (0·90 [0·82, 0.98]).

CONCLUSION: Amongst males, non-smokers, overweight/obese, and non-Black participants, having early-onset asthma was associated with lower risk of a SARS-CoV-2 positive test. We found no evidence of a protective effect from asthma medication. Early-onset asthmatics of normal weight and with better lung function may have lifestyle differences placing them at higher risk.

Research on scalable, tailored, online mindfulness training programs is needed. We sought to test the feasibility and acceptability of a remotely delivered 8-week mindfulness-based intervention, Being Present 2.0 (BP2.0). METHODS: We performed a single-arm feasibility study of BP2.0 among patients with any metastatic gastrointestinal cancer receiving chemotherapy, with or without an informal caregiver. Participants were instructed to practice mindfulness using pre-recorded guided meditations 5 times per week using a study-specific website and to attend a weekly live, interactive virtual meeting facilitated by a trained instructor. The web-based platform enabled direct measurement of adherence. RESULTS: The study enrolled 46 of 74 (62%) patients contacted, together with 23 caregivers (69 participants total), from May to October 2018. Median patient age was 52 (range 20-70 years), 39% were male, 67% non-Hispanic white, 65% had colorectal cancer, and 78% lived outside of San Francisco. The top reasons cited for participation were to reduce stress/anxiety and learn how to meditate. Mean baseline National Comprehensive Cancer Network Distress Thermometer (NCCN DT) scores were 4.7 (patients) and 5.8 (caregivers). The study discontinuation rate was 20% (eight patients and six caregivers). Among the remaining 55 participants, 43 (78%) listened to at least one audio recording and/or attended at least one virtual meeting, although adherence data was incomplete. The retention rate was 71%, with 39 participants completing at least one follow-up assessment. In post-intervention qualitative interviews, 88% of respondents reported a positive experience. Compared to baseline, participants reported significantly reduced post-intervention NCCN DT scores (mean 3.1; P = .012). CONCLUSION: The BP2.0 online mindfulness-based program is feasible and acceptable for patients with metastatic gastrointestinal cancer and caregivers.

The anti‐inflammatory drug colchicine seems to reduce ischemic events in patients with CAD. So far there is equipoise about its safety and impact on mortality. METHODS AND RESULTS: To evaluate the utility of colchicine in patients with acute and chronic CAD, we performed a systematic review and meta‐analysis. MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane CENTRAL and conference abstracts were searched from January 1975 to October 2020. Randomized trials assessing colchicine compared with placebo/standard therapy in patients with CAD were included. Data were combined using random‐effects models. The reliability of the available data was tested using trial sequential analyses . Of 3108 citations, 13 randomized trials (n=13 125) were included. Colchicine versus placebo/standard therapy in patients with CAD reduced risk of myocardial infarction (odds ratio [OR] 0.64; 95% CI, 0.46–0.90; P=0.01; I (2) 41%) and stroke/transient ischemic attack (OR 0.50; 95% CI, 0.31–0.81; P=0.005; I (2) 0%).

Colchicine increased the risk for gastrointestinal side effects (P<0.001). According to trial sequential analyses, there is only sufficient evidence for a myocardial infarction risk reduction with colchicine.

To analyse epidemiologic and clinical characteristics of the four types of human parainfluenza viruses (HPIVs), patients with acute respiratory tract illness (ARTI) were studied in Guangzhou, southern China. METHODS: Throat swabs (n=4755) were collected and tested from children and adults with ARTI over a 26-month period, and 4447 of 4755 (93.5%) patients’ clinical presentations were recorded for further analysis. RESULTS: Of 4755 patients tested, 178 (3.7%) were positive for HPIV. Ninety-nine (2.1%) samples were positive for HPIV-3, 58 (1.2%) for HPIV-1, 19 (0.4%) for HPIV-2 and 8 (0.2%) for HPIV-4. 160/178 (88.9%) HPIV-positive samples were from paediatric patients younger than 5 years old, but no infant under one month of age was HPIV positive. Seasonal peaks of HPIV-3 and HPIV-1 occurred as autumn turned to winter and summer turned to autumn. HPIV-2 and HPIV-4 were detected less frequently, and their frequency of isolation increased when the frequency of HPIV-3 and HPIV-1 declined. HPIV infection led to a wide spectrum of symptoms, and more “hoarseness” (p=0.015), “abnormal pulmonary breathing sound” (p<0.001), “dyspnoea” (p<0.001), “pneumonia” (p=0.01), and “diarrhoea” (p<0.001) presented in HPIV-positive patients than HPIV-negative patients. 10/10 (100%) HPIV-positive adult patients (≥14 years old) presented with systemic influenza-like symptoms, while 90/164 (54.9%) HPIV-positive paediatric patients (<14 years old) presented with these symptoms (p=0.005). The only significant difference in clinical presentation between HPIV types was “Expectoration” (p<0.001). Co-infections were common, with 33.3%–63.2% of samples positive for the four HPIV types also testing positive for other respiratory pathogens. However, no significant differences were seen in clinical presentation between patients solely infected with HPIV and patients co-infected with HPIV and other respiratory pathogens.

It has become a major cause of concern for health care professionals all over the world. Objective The aim of this study was to assess knowledge, awareness and hygiene practices regarding COVID-19 among private dental practitioners practicing in Tricity (Chandigarh, Panchkula and Mohali) in India during these critical times. Materials and Methods A total of 245 private dentists participated in this cross-sectional survey and finally 215 constituted the final sample size. A self-administered, multiple choice type questionnaire (verified by a specialist) was administered to obtain information from the subjects. The questionnaire was divided into two parts and included 15 questions on knowledge and awareness regarding COVID-19. Statistical analysis was done using ANOVA and Student’s t-test. Results Percentage of subjects who answered correctly regarding main symptoms of COVID-19 and primary mode of transmission was 87% and 82.5% respectively. One-third of the subjects were not aware regarding Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) to be used while rendering dental treatment. 75% of subjects were of the opinion that supportive care is the current treatment regime for COVID-19. Less than one-third of subjects (30.2%) reported high scores. Education level (p=0.018) and health sector profile (p=0.024) of the subjects were significantly associated with mean knowledge scores. Conclusion The findings of the present study showed that some notable deficiencies in knowledge existed among dental professionals regarding some vital aspects of COVID-19.

It was hypothesized that the exposure to the COVID-19 increased distress directly and through the mediation of worry, health-related information seeking, and perception of the utility of the lockdown. It was also expected that higher levels of ambiguity intolerance corresponded to higher distress directly and through the mediation of worry, health information seeking behaviors, and perceived utility of the lockdown. Finally, it was expected that risk aversion positively influenced distress directly and through the increasing of worry, health-related information seeking behavior, and more positive perception of the utility of the lockdown The study was conducted in Italy during the mandatory lockdown for COVID-19 pandemic on 240 individuals (age range 18-76). Data recruitment was conducted via snowball sampling. COVID-19 exposure was positively associated with worry and health-related information seeking. Risk-aversion was positively associated with health-related information seeking and perceived utility of the lockdown to contain the spread of the virus. Worry and health-related information seeking were positively associated with distress, whereas the perceived utility of the lockdown was negatively associated with distress. Intolerance for the ambiguity was directly linked to distress with a positive sign.

Even at 5% HPC level, the tablet tensile strength achieved up to 3.5 MPa. A minimum of 10% HPC was required for the process robustness. However, 20% HPC led to tabletability loss, attributable to the high mechanical strength of APAP granules. The over-granulated APAP granules had thick connected HPC scaffold and low porosity. Consequently, these granules were so strong that they underwent a lower degree of fracture under compression and higher elastic recovery during decompression. HPC was enriched on the surface of APAP extrudates at all HPC levels. Amorphous APAP was also observed on the extrudate surface at 20% HPC level, and it recrystallized within 24 h storage. To achieve a robust process and optimal improvement in APAP tabletability, the preferred HPC level was 10 to 15%.",2020-08-24,"Liu, Tongzhou; Paul, Shubhajit; Beeson, Brian T; Alexander, Johnny; Yang, Fengyuan; Bi, Vivian; Durig, Thomas; Sun, Changquan Calvin; Zhang, Feng",AAPS PharmSciTech,,,,,,https://doi.org/10.1208/s12249-020-01785-y; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32839891/,221283793.0

This study aimed to: (i) determine the impact of the pandemic on patterns of AOD use among individuals seeking treatment, (ii) identify which mental health and resilience factors were associated with changes in patterns of AOD use and (iii) evaluate changes in the contextual factors (eg, motivations) associated with use. METHODS: Cross-sectional surveys were completed by clients (n = 325) who had sought AOD treatment from January 2020 onwards. We measured quantity and frequency of AOD use now compared to before the pandemic, mental health (depression, anxiety, trauma exposure), resilience and contextual factors related to AOD use. RESULTS: Quantity of tobacco and cannabis use increased post-pandemic, while methamphetamine and alcohol did not change. Depression was associated with more frequent alcohol use now compared to before the pandemic, while anxiety and lower resilience were associated with less frequent cannabis use now. Lower resilience was associated changes in methamphetamine use. Depression was associated with using more frequently for enjoyment and to alleviate loneliness following the pandemic, and anxiety was associated with using earlier in the day and to alleviate boredom. CONCLUSIONS: The pandemic has led to increased frequency of AOD use for a subset of individuals seeking treatment.

Tests in use for diagnosing COVID-19 infection in India included molecular based tests - RT-PCR, TrueNat and CBNAATAs. As COVID-19 primarily targets the lungs, Chest Computed Tomography (CT) would play a crucial role in the diagnosis, evaluation, and management of the disease. Study was done to assess the diagnostic accuracy of chest computed tomography (CT) in clinically suspected COVID - 19 patients using RT-PCR as the reference standard and establish the correlation between CT Severity Score (CTSS) and RT-PCR results. Material: A single centre tertiary care hospital based retrospective cohort suty was performed on 112 clinically suspected COVID - 19 patients between 1st April 2021 and 31st May 2021. Chest CT and RT-PCR tests were performed for all patients at a time interval of no longer than 7 days between the two tests. Patients with prior chronic respiratory illnesses were excluded. The diagnostic performance of Chest CT was evaluated using RT-PCR as the reference standard. The CTSS was calculated for all patients with positive Chest CT findings, and it was correlated with results of the RT-PCR assay. The primary outcome measures were determination of the sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), negative predictive value (NPV), and diagnostic accuracy of Chest CT using RT-PCR as the standard of reference. The correlation between CTSS and RT-PCR was the secondary outcome. Observation: 85/112 (76%) patients tested positive on the RT-PCR whereas 91/112 (81%) had chest CT findings typical of SARS-CoV2 infection. Chest CT had a sensitivity of 90.6% [95% CI, 82.3% - 95.8%], a specificity of 48.1% [95% CI 28.7% - 68.0%], a PPV of 84.6% [95% CI, 79.2% - 88.8%], a NPV of 61.9% [95% CI, 43.0% - 77.8%] and an accuracy of 80.4% [95% CI, 71.8% - 87.3%]. There was a significant correlation between the CTSS and RT-PCR positivity (p value = 0.003) Conclusion: Chest CT has a good sensitivity in detecting COVID-19 pneumonia and is useful for moderate to-severe COVID-19 cases in resource limited settings, where RT-PCR testing is cumbersome due to lack of personnel, time, and diagnostic kits.",2022,"Jyoti, Divya; Mehta, Vishal",J Assoc Physicians India,,#covidwho-1801454,,,,,246079596.0

NS1 is also secreted, as a hexamer, to the extracellular milieu. Circulating NS1 has been associated with dengue pathogenesis by several mechanisms. Cell binding and internalization of soluble NS1 result in endothelial hyperpermeability and in the downregulation of the innate immune response. In this work, we report that the HDL scavenger receptor B1 (SRB1) in human hepatic cells and a scavenger receptor B1-like in mosquito C6/36 cells act as cell surface binding receptors for dengue virus NS1. The presence of the SRB1 on the plasma membrane of C6/36 cells, as well as in Huh7 cells, was demonstrated by confocal microscopy. The internalization of NS1 can be efficiently blocked by anti-SRB1 antibodies and previous incubation of the cells with HDL significantly reduces NS1 internalization. Significant reduction in NS1 internalization was observed in C6/36 cells transfected with siRNAs specific for SRB1. In addition, the transient expression of SRB1 in Vero cells, which lacks the receptor, allows NS1 internalization in these cells. Direct interaction between soluble NS1 and the SRB1 in Huh7 and C6/36 cells was demonstrated in situ by proximity ligation assays and in vitro by surface plasmon resonance. Finally, results are presented indicating that the SRB1 also acts as a cell receptor for Zika virus NS1. These results demonstrate that dengue virus NS1, a bona fide lipoprotein, usurps the HDL receptor for cell entry and offers explanations for the altered serum lipoprotein homeostasis observed in dengue patients. Importance Dengue is the most common viral disease transmitted to humans by mosquitoes. The dengue virus NS1 is a multifunctional glycoprotein necessary for viral replication. NS1 is also secreted as a hexameric lipoprotein and circulates in high concentrations in the sera of patients. Circulating NS1 has been associated with dengue pathogenesis by several mechanisms, including favoring of virus replication in hepatocytes and dendritic cells and disruption of the endothelial glycocalyx leading to hyperpermeability. Those last actions require NS1 internalization. Here, we identify the scavenger cell receptor B1, as the cell-binding receptor for dengue and Zika virus NS1, in cultured liver and in mosquito cells.

Emerging lines of evidence indicate that HCV triggers a wide range of cellular stress responses, including cell cycle arrest, apoptosis, endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress/unfolded protein response (UPR), and autophagy. Also, recent studies suggest that these HCV-induced cellular responses may contribute to chronic liver diseases by modulating cell proliferation, altering lipid metabolism, and potentiating oncogenic pathways.

The absence of a globally distributed effective treatment makes the exploration of new mechanisms of action a key step to address this situation. Stabilization of non-native Protein-Protein Interactions (PPIs) of the nucleocapsid protein of MERS-CoV has been reported as a valid strategy to inhibit viral replication. In this study, the applicability of this unexplored mechanism of action against SARS-CoV-2 is analyzed. During our research, we were able to find three inducible interfaces of SARS-CoV-2 N protein NTD, compare them to the previously reported MERS-CoV stabilized dimers, and identify those residues that are responsible for their formation. A drug discovery protocol implemented consisting of docking, molecular dynamics and MM-GBSA enabled us to find several compounds that might be able to exploit this mechanism of action. In addition, a common catechin skeleton was found among many of these molecules, which might be useful for further drug design.

B.1.1.7 grew when other lineages declined during the second national lockdown and regionally tiered restrictions between November and December 2020. A third more stringent national lockdown eventually suppressed B.1.1.7 and eliminated nearly all other lineages in early 2021. However, a series of variants (mostly containing the spike E484K mutation) defied these trends and persisted at moderately increasing proportions. Accounting for sustained introductions, however, indicates that their transmissibility is unlikely to exceed that of B.1.1.7. Finally, B.1.617.2 was repeatedly introduced to England and grew rapidly in April 2021, constituting approximately 40% of sampled COVID-19 genomes on May 15.",2021-05-26,"Vohringer, H.

h6a4oakb,,WHO,Equity Leadership for English Learners During COVID-19: Early Lessons,,,,unk,"This article provides the findings of an exploratory, qualitative study on distance learning policies and practices from a purposeful sample of five California school districts and 25 district and school leaders with large numbers and/or larger percentages of current or former English Learners. To understand the extent to which leaders address English Learners’/Emergent Bilinguals’ (EL/EM) needs during the pandemic, we posed the following research question: What are leaders’ local policies and practices in designing and implementing distance learning to promote equity for English Learners? We gathered three key district policy documents across three moments during the pandemic: (1) COVID-19 Operations Written Reports (Spring 2020), (2) School Reopening Plans (Summer 2020), and (3) Learning Continuity and Attendance Plans (Fall 2020). We also conducted interviews and triangulated data sources using grounded theory to analyze and understand how equity is framed and implemented. Data triangulation and iterative rounds of coding allowed us to identify three inter-related findings: (1) leading in the crisis of connectivity and bridging the digital divide;(2) maximizing diverse ELs’ learning experiences;and, (3) building from collaborative leadership cultures to collaborative virtual leadership cultures. Using these key findings, we conceptualized the framework for equity leadership for English Learners to address the needs of this underserved population. We conclude with a call for further examination, in both leadership preparation as well as in policy implementation research. © Copyright © 2021 Lavadenz, Kaminski, Armas and López.",2021,"Lavadenz, M.; Kaminski, L.

The detection of mycotoxins is therefore necessary as a preventive action to avoid the harmful contamination of foodstuffs and animal feed. In comparison with the considerable expense of treating contaminated foodstuffs, early detection is a cost-effective way to ensure food safety. The high affinity of bio-recognition molecules to mycotoxins has led to the development of affinity columns for sample pre-treatment and the development of biosensors for the quantitative analysis of mycotoxins. Aptamers are a very attractive class of biological receptors that are currently in great demand for the development of new biosensors. In this review, the improvement in the materials and methodology, and the working principles and performance of both conventional and recently developed methods are discussed. The key features and applications of the fundamental recognition elements, such as antibodies and aptamers are addressed.

This review aimed at summarizing and discussing recent advances concerning the management of muscle disease in systemic diseases. METHOD: Literature review by search of MEDLINE, and Current Contents with appropriate search terms. RESULTS: Secondary muscle disease occurs in infectious disease, endocrine disorders, metabolic disorders, immunological disease, vascular diseases, hematological disorders, and malignancies. Muscle manifestations in these categories include pathogen‐caused myositis, muscle infarction, rhabdomyolysis, myasthenia, immune‐mediated myositis, necrotising myopathy, or vasculitis‐associated myopathy. Muscle affection may concern only a single muscle, a group of muscles, or the entire musculature. Severity of muscle affection may be transient or permanent, may be a minor part of or may dominate the clinical picture, or may be mild or severe, requiring invasive measures including artificial ventilation if the respiratory muscles are additionally involved. Diagnostic work‐up is similar to that of primary myopathies by application of non‐invasive and invasive techniques. Treatment of muscle involvement in systemic diseases is based on elimination of the underlying cause and supportive measures. The prognosis is usually fair if the causative disorder is effectively treatable but can be fatal in single cases if the entire musculature including the respiratory muscles is involved, in case of infection, or in case of severe rhabdomyolysis. CONCLUSION: Secondary muscle manifestations of systemic diseases must be addressed and appropriately managed.

Methods Eligible patients received open-label infusions of vedolizumab 300 mg intravenous (IV) at weeks 0 and 2 in the induction phase. Patients with clinical response by complete Mayo score at week 6 entered the double-blind maintenance phase and were randomized to vedolizumab 108 mg SC every 2 weeks, placebo, or vedolizumab 300 mg IV every 8 weeks. The primary endpoint was clinical remission (complete Mayo score ≤ 2 points; no individual subscore > 1 point) at week 52. Results Of 49 patients who entered the induction phase, 22 out of 49 patients (45%) had clinical response at week 6 and were randomized to vedolizumab 108 mg SC (n = 10), placebo (n = 10), or vedolizumab 300 mg IV (n = 2). At week 52, 4 out of 10 patients (40%) who received vedolizumab SC had clinical remission versus 2 out of 10 patients (20%) who received placebo (difference: 20% [95% confidence interval, -27.9 to 61.8]). Two patients (2/10, 20%) who received vedolizumab SC experienced an injection-site reaction versus none who received placebo. Conclusions Our results indicate that the efficacy of vedolizumab SC in a subgroup of Japanese patients with UC are similar with those in the overall VISIBLE 1 study population, and with those established with vedolizumab IV. The safety and tolerability of vedolizumab SC were generally similar to that established for vedolizumab IV.

This may be of concern for practitioners who wish to vaccinate dogs with all components on the same day. This study aimed at evaluating immunological compatibility between a monovalent rabies vaccine (Rabisin™) and two large combination vaccines against CDV, CAV, CPV, CPiV with 2 leptospira components +Cv (Recombitek® C6/Cv) or with 4 Leptospira components (Recombitek® C8), when injected concomitantly at two separate injection sites. Fourteen days after administration of the rabies vaccine, with or without concomitant administration of combo vaccines, all dogs had seroconverted against rabies and maintained protective titers over the duration of the study.

This study aimed to determine the main concerns of dental and oral health workers globally during COVID-19 outbreaks and the coping strategies that help the resilience of dental and oral healthcare system. METHODS: This scoping study was conducted in August 2020. After adjusting the search strategy, a systematic search of five databases (PubMed, ISI Web of Science, Scopus, ProQuest and EMBASE) was conducted. Data was extracted using Microsoft Excel and the contents of retrieved articles were analysed through a qualitative thematic analysis applying MAX QDA(10). RESULTS: Most articles were either editorial/letters to the editor/commentary formats (34%), or literature reviews (26%). About half of the articles belonged to three countries of Italy, China and the USA (each 16% and totally 48%). Thematic analysis of included papers led to the identification of four main global concerns and 19 sub-concerns. Economic, ethical, social and professional concerns are among dental and oral health concerns.

It might be involvedin the progression to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), multi-organ failure leading to death. In this study, we aimed to evaluate the prognostic value of the immune-inflammatory biomarkersin COVID-19, then determine optimal thresholds for assessing severe and fatal forms of this disease.153 patients with confirmed COVID-19 were included in this study, and classified into non-severe and severe groups. Plasmatic levels of interleukin 6 (IL6), C-reactive protein (CRP), soluble-IL2 receptor (IL2Rα), procalcitonin (PCT) and ferritin were measured using chemiluminescence assay. Complete blood count was performed by Convergys 3X® hematology analyzer.

Nonetheless, only a few studies have thus far evaluated the degree of fear of COVID-19, partially due to the lack of validated measures. In this study we evaluated the psychometric properties of the Hebrew version of the Fear of COVID-19 scale (FCV-19S), recently developed to assess different aspects of the fear of the pandemic, in a normative population of participants in Israel. Participants (n = 639) were asked to complete the FCV-19S scale, as well as to report anxiety, depression, and stress levels using validated scales. The results a unidimensional factor structure of the FCV-19S which explained 53.71% of the variance. When forcing a two-factor structure model, the analysis revealed two factors pertaining to emotional fear reactions and symptomatic expressions of fear. Gender, sociodemographic status, chronic illness, being in an at-risk group, and having a family member dying of COVID-19 were positively associated with fear of COVID-19. The measure was associated with anxiety, stress and depression.

ADSC-MNP from levitated spheroid displayed higher viability, proliferation and mobility compared to nonlevitated and 2D culture. Levitated and nonlevitated ADSC-MNP spheroids underwent three lineage differentiation, demonstrating preserved ADSC stemness. Quantitative osteogenesis showed similar values in MNP-loaded levitated and nonlevitated spheroids. Significant increases in adipogenic conversion was observed for all 3D formulation. Chondrogenic conversion in levitated and nonlevitated spheroids produced comparable ratio glucosaminoglycan (GAG)/DNA. Increased chondrogenesis could be observed for ADSC-MNP in both levitated and nonlevitated condition. Taken together, ADSC-MNP levitated spheroids retain stemness and display superior cell viability and migratory capabilities.

The past decade has seen an increasing number of countries and proportion of the global population covered by smoke-free policies to some extent. Despite reductions in global smoking prevalence, population growth means that the number of non-smokers exposed to the harms caused by secondhand smoke remains high. Smoke-free policy measures have been shown to be useful in protecting non-smokers from secondhand smoke, and can additionally increase cessation and reduce smoking initiation. Policies tend to be aimed primarily at enclosed public or workplace settings with very few countries attempting to control exposure in private or semiprivate spaces such as homes and cars, and, as a result, children may be benefiting less from smoke-free measures than adults. Compliance with legislation also varies by country and there is a need for education and empowerment together with guidance and changing social norms to help deliver the full benefits that smoke-free spaces can bring.

7bk00nyb,,WHO,A novel strategy for SARS-CoV-2 mass screening with quantitative antigen testing of saliva: a diagnostic accuracy study,,,,unk,"Background: Quantitative RT-PCR (RT-qPCR) of nasopharyngeal swab (NPS) samples for SARS-CoV-2 detection requires medical personnel and is time consuming, and thus is poorly suited to mass screening. In June, 2020, a chemiluminescent enzyme immunoassay (CLEIA; Lumipulse G SARS-CoV-2 Ag kit, Fujirebio, Tokyo, Japan) was developed that can detect SARS-CoV-2 nucleoproteins in NPS or saliva samples within 35 min. In this study, we assessed the utility of CLEIA in mass SARS-CoV-2 screening. Methods: We did a diagnostic accuracy study to develop a mass-screening strategy for salivary detection of SARS-CoV-2 by CLEIA, enrolling hospitalised patients with clinically confirmed COVID-19, close contacts identified at community health centres, and asymptomatic international arrivals at two airports, all based in Japan. All test participants were enrolled consecutively. We assessed the diagnostic accuracy of CLEIA compared with RT-qPCR, estimated according to concordance (Kendall's coefficient of concordance, W), and sensitivity (probability of CLEIA positivity given RT-qPCR positivity) and specificity (probability of CLEIA negativity given RT-qPCR negativity) for different antigen concentration cutoffs (0·19 pg/mL, 0·67 pg/mL, and 4·00 pg/mL; with samples considered positive if the antigen concentration was equal to or more than the cutoff and negative if it was less than the cutoff). We also assessed a two-step testing strategy post hoc with CLEIA as an initial test, using separate antigen cutoff values for test negativity and positivity from the predefined cutoff values. The proportion of intermediate results requiring secondary RT-qPCR was then quantified assuming prevalence values of RT-qPCR positivity in the overall tested population of 10%, 30%, and 50%. Findings: Self-collected saliva was obtained from 2056 participants between June 12 and Aug 6, 2020. Results of CLEIA and RT-qPCR were concordant in 2020 (98·2%) samples (Kendall's W=0·99). Test sensitivity was 85·4% (76 of 89 positive samples; 90% credible interval [CrI] 78·0-90·3) at the cutoff of 0·19 pg/mL; 76·4% (68 of 89; 68·2-82·8) at the cutoff of 0·67 pg/mL; and 52·8% (47 of 89; 44·1-61·3) at the cutoff of 4·0 pg/mL. Test specificity was 91·3% (1796 of 1967 negative samples; 90% CrI 90·2-92·3) at the cutoff of 0·19 pg/mL, 99·2% (1952 of 1967; 98·8-99·5) at the cutoff of 0·67 pg/mL, and 100·0% (1967 of 1967; 99·8-100·0) at the cutoff of 4·00 pg/mL. Using a two-step testing strategy with a CLEIA negativity cutoff of 0·19 pg/mL (to maximise sensitivity) and a CLEIA positivity cutoff of 4·00 pg/mL (to maximise specificity), the proportions of indeterminate results (ie, samples requiring secondary RT-qPCR) would be approximately 11% assuming a prevalence of RT-qPCR positivity of 10%, 16% assuming a prevalence of RT-qPCR positivity of 30%, and 21% assuming a prevalence of RT-qPCR positivity of 50%. Interpretation: CLEIA testing of self-collected saliva is simple and provides results quickly, and is thus suitable for mass testing. To improve accuracy, we propose a two-step screening strategy with an initial CLEIA test followed by confirmatory RT-qPCR for intermediate concentrations, varying positive and negative thresholds depending on local prevalence. Implementation of this strategy has expedited sample processing at Japanese airports since July, 2020, and might apply to other large-scale mass screening initiatives.

We aimed to assess the level of anxiety and trust in information resources among Iranians’ HWs. Methods: A web-based cross-sectional survey was conducted on 1199 HWs between March and April 2020 in Iran. Data on demographic variables, sources of information about the COVID-19, and the trust level to them were collected using online self-administered questionnaires. The anxiety severity level was assessed using the Zung self-rating anxiety scale. Data were analyzed using simple and multiple linear regression models. Results: The mean age of participants was 32.5 ± 8.79, and 65.7% (n = 763) were male. 30.4% (95% confidence interval (CI) (CI: 27.8%–33.1%) of HWs had mild to moderate, and 21.3% (95% CI: 18.9%–23.7%) had severe and extremely severe levels of anxiety. TV (83.7%) and social media networks (58.2%) were the most frequent information sources. The lowest trust level and highest anxiety levels, and in contrast, the highest trust level and lowest anxiety levels were observed among social media users and TV viewers, respectively. The results of the multiple linear analysis showed that less work experience (P = 0.003), master’s degree or above (P = 0.006), being divorced or widowed (P < 0.001), higher levels of exposure to COVID-19 patients (P < 0.05), having a history of mental illness (P < 0.001), and having underlying medical conditions (P < 0.001) were associated with higher anxiety levels. Conclusion: The study results revealed that the anxiety level among the HWs is relatively significant, and the trust level in social media networks was the lowest.

Mutations in the amino acid 484 of the Spike protein are particularly important and associated with some of these variants: E484K or E484Q. These mutations have been associated with evasion to neutralizing antibodies. Restriction enzyme analysis is proposed as a rapid method to detect these mutations. A search on GISAID was performed in April 2021 to detect the frequency of these two mutations in the sequence available and their association with other lineages. E484K, present in some VOCs, has emerged in several other lineages and is frequently found in recent viral isolates. A small amplicon from the Spike gene was digested with two enzymes: HpyAV, and MseI. The use of these two enzymes allows the detection of mutations at position 484, and to differentiate between these three conditions: non-mutated, and the presence of E484K or E484Q.

Agreement between tentative diagnosis via synchronous audioconferencing and definitive clinical diagnosis,10.1016/j.jdent.2022.104144,PMC9040478,35487287.0,no-cc,"OBJECTIVES: To assess the reliability of synchronous audioconferencing teledentistry (TD) in making tentative diagnosis compared to definitive clinical face-to-face (CFTF) diagnosis; and whether agreement was influenced by dentist's experience, caller-patient relationship, and time of call. METHODS: All patients calling the TD hotline during COVID-19 pandemic, triaged as emergency/ urgent and referred for CFTF care were included (N=191). Hotline dentists triaged the calls, made tentative audio-dentistry (AD) diagnosis, while dentists at point of referral made the definitive CFTF diagnosis. Cohen's weighted kappa (κ) assessed the extent of agreement between AD vs CFTF diagnosis. RESULTS: There was significantly very good pair-wise agreement (κ = 0.853, P < 0.0001) between AD and CFTF diagnosis. AD diagnosis of pulpitis and periodontitis exhibited the most frequent disagreements. Tele-dentists with ≥ 20 years’ experience exhibited the highest level of agreement (κ =0.872, P < 0.0001). There was perfect agreement when mothers mediated the call (κ = 1, P < 0.0001), and very good agreement for calls received between 7 am-2 pm (κ = 0.880, P < 0.0001) compared to calls received between 2-10 pm (κ = 0.793, P < 0.0001). CONCLUSIONS: Remote tentative diagnosis using AD is safe and reliable. Reliability was generally very good but varied by dentist's experience, caller-patient relationship, and time of call. CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE: The findings suggest that using AD in the home environment is safe and reliable, deploying providers with variable years of experience. The findings have generalizability potential to a variety of similar circumstances, healthcare settings and epi/pandemic situations.",2022-04-26,"Ali, Shaymaa Abdulreda; Ansari, Walid El",J Dent,,,,document_parses/pdf_json/27a2ff66a29f10f68dfa82f4e1358ce0abbb5a58.json,document_parses/pmc_json/PMC9040478.xml.json,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/35487287/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jdent.2022.104144; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0300571222002007; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0300571222002007?v=s5,248396254.0

RT-qPCR is the gold standard test, and comparison of methodologies and reagents, utilizing patient samples, is important to establish reliable diagnostic pipelines. METHODS: Here, we assessed indirect methods that require RNA extraction with direct RT-qPCR on patient samples. Four different RNA extraction kits (Qiagen, Invitrogen, BGI and Norgen Biotek) were compared. For detection, we assessed two recently developed Taqman-based modules (BGI and Norgen Biotek), a SYBR green-based approach (NEB Luna Universal One-Step Kit) with published and newly-developed primers, and clinical results (Seegene STARMag RNA extraction system and Allplex 2019-nCoV RT-qPCR assay). We also tested and optimized direct, extraction-free detection using these RT-qPCR systems and performed a cost analysis of the different methods evaluated here. RESULTS: Most RNA isolation procedures performed similarly, and while all RT-qPCR modules effectively detected purified viral RNA, the BGI system provided overall superior performance (lower detection limit, lower Ct values and higher sensitivity), generating comparable results to original clinical diagnostic data, and identifying samples ranging from 65 copies to 2.1 × 10(5) copies of viral genome/μl. However, the BGI detection system is more expensive than other options tested here. With direct RT-qPCR, simply adding an RNase inhibitor greatly improved detection, without the need for any other treatments (e.g. lysis buffers or boiling). The best direct methods detected ~ 10 fold less virus than indirect methods, but this simplified approach reduced sample handling, as well as assay time and cost. CONCLUSIONS: With extracted RNA, the BGI RT-qPCR detection system exhibited superior performance over the Norgen system, matching initial clinical diagnosis with the Seegene Allplex assay. The BGI system was also suitable for direct, extraction-free analysis, providing 78.4% sensitivity. The Norgen system, however, still accurately detected samples with a clinical Ct < 33 from extracted RNA, provided significant cost savings, and was superior to SYBR green assays that exhibited reduced specificity.

While there are initial reports of the prevalence of COVID-19 antibodies among the general population, there are few reports comparing the seroprevalence of IgM/IgG COVID-19 antibodies in HCW of different exposure levels as well as different HCW professions. METHODS: A convenience sample of health care workers provided blood for COVID-19 antibody testing and a review of medical history and work exposure for correlative analyses. RESULTS: Overall, 474 HCW were enrolled in April 2020 including 102 front-line physicians (e.g., anesthesiologists, surgeons, intensivists, emergency medicine), 91 other physicians, 135 nurses, 134 other clinical staff, and 12 non-clinical HCW. The prevalence of IgM or IgG antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 was 16.9% (95% CI 13.6–20.6) (80/474). The proportion of positive antibodies in the PCR + group was significantly higher than health care workers without symptoms (84.6% [95% CI 54.6–98.1] vs. 12.3% [95% CI 8.5–17.2], p < 0.001). No significant differences in proportions of COVID-19 antibodies were observed among the different exposure groups (e.g., high vs minimal/no exposure) and among the different HCW professionals. CONCLUSIONS: Despite exposure to COVID-19 patients, the prevalence of antibodies in our HCW was similar to what has been reported for the general population of New York State (14%) and for another New York HCW cohort (13.7%). Health care workers with higher exposure rates were not more likely to have been infected with COVID-19. Therefore, these data suggest that infection of HCW may result from exposure in the community rather than at work.

Reporting the reduction of in person horse shows and an early assessment of its impact on the economy was the objective of this study. The survey instrument was disseminated to horse show participants through web-based modes and email. A Qualtrics survey was posted on numerous social media pages, including extension, horse shows, and breed associations and was also emailed to the APHA listserv of show participants (n = 251). Most survey respondents were female (n = 240;95.6%) representing a cross-section of US states (n = 42;84.0%). Participants reported planning to attend an average of 9.7 (SD = 7.15) in person horse shows in 2020, and had to miss an average of 4.17 (SD = 3.11) shows due to COVID-19 restrictions as of June 15, 2020. Horse show participants reported spending a mean of $991 (SD = $648.26;Range = $0.00 to $4,000.00) per show and therefore $9,612 annually on horse show-related expenses. Specific expenditures that were collected included lodging (either hotel or RV), fuel, meals, entry fees, stalls/boarding, and miscellaneous. The American Horse Council (2018) reported 1,227,986 horses make up the competition sector. On average, each horse owner shows 1.57 horses (US Equestrian Federation) and therefore horse show participation generates $7.5 billion annually when utilizing this survey's responses of average show expenditures of $991 per show. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the decreased attendance of in person shows from 9.7 to 5.53, resulted in a decrease in annual expenditures with an early estimation of potential economic loss to be $3.23 billion. In this study, the quantified direct effects were then used in the IMPLAN input-output model to estimate the total economic impact of expenditures within the economy. A reduction in economic output of $7.2 billion and a reduction in approximately 50,000 jobs that are directly or indirectly connected to the horse show industry, was the result of decreased attendance of in person horse shows. Additionally, the industry's contribution to GDP (value added) was reduced by $3.95 billion. Economic hardship caused by the COVID-19 pandemic has stretched across most sectors of the economy, including the horse show industry.

Objectives: The objective of this study was to assess the anxiety levels of employees at a public university in the state of São Paulo who were put on leave due to suspected or confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection and to correlate their anxiety levels with personal and work-related variables. Methods: This cross-sectional study used an online survey to collect data from employees who took a diagnostic test for COVID-19. The participants’ anxiety level was measured using Greenberger and Padesky’s Anxiety Inventory, while data on personal and work-related variables were collected through a socio-demographic questionnaire. Results: Most of the 153 participants (76.5%) reported anxiety symptoms. COVID-19 infection was confirmed in 51%. The highest prevalence of severe anxiety (27%) was among employees who had indirect contact with COVID-19 patients. Three variables – being a woman, being a regular employee, and previous physical health problems – were responsible for a higher risk of anxiety. Conclusions: This study’s findings indicate the need to protect the mental health of the university’s employees. © 2021 Associacao Nacional de Medicina do Trabalho.

I have argued in a national newspaper for the distinction between teaching with technology and teaching through technology. In this exploratory article, I engage with this distinction and move towards developing a model of online pedagogy that can lead to learning, in the absence of face to face engagement. The article argues for a pedagogical model capable of delivering content in the absence of a face to face teacher and illustrates this through data from an online intervention with my Honours students. The case study described is exploratory in nature and seeks to understand how an intervention can be set up to effect acquisition, rather than seeking to provide evidence for the success of such an intervention. I draw on the work of Vygotsky (1978) and Hedegaard (1998) to provide a picture of developmental pedagogy that leads to cognitive development.

The purpose of our study was to explore risk factors and develop a prognostic nomogram for lower extremity DVT in neurointensive care unit patients. METHODS: We prospectively collected and analyzed the clinical data of 420 neurointensive care unit patients who received treatment in our institution between January 2018 and September 2019. Stepwise logistic regression was used to select predictors. R software was used to develop the prognostic nomogram. The performance of the nomogram was validated using a validation cohort of patients with data collected between October 2019 and March 2020. RESULTS: Among 420 patients, 153 (36.4%) had lower extremity DVT and five (1.2%) had both DVT and pulmonary embolism (PE) in our study. Logistic regression analysis indicated that age [odds ratio (OR): 1.050; 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.029–1.071; P < 0.001], Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score (OR: 0.889; 95% CI: 0.825–0.959; P = 0.002), D-dimer level (OR: 1.040; 95% CI: 1.008–1.074; P = 0.014), muscle strength (OR: 2.424; 95% CI: 1.346–4.366; P = 0.003), and infection (OR: 1.778; 95% CI: 1.034–3.055; P = 0.037) were independent predictors for lower extremity DVT. These predictors were selected to be included in the nomogram model. The area under the curve values in the primary cohort and validation cohort were 0.817 (95% CI: 0.776–0.858) and 0.778 (95% CI: 0.688–0.868), respectively, and respective Brier scores were 0.167 and 0.183.

This study analyzed patient and surgeon satisfaction in the utilization of telehealth within the hand surgery division during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: All hand surgery patients who completed a telemedicine visit from March 30th, 2020 through April 30th, 2020 completed a 14-question survey via e-mail. Hand surgeons who participated in telemedicine completed a separate 14-question survey. Survey results were presented descriptively (mean ± standard deviation) and patient factors influencing satisfaction were determined using univariate and multivariate proportional modeling. Results: 89 patients and five surgeons completed the surveys. Patients were very satisfied with their telemedicine visits (4.21/5.00 ± 0.89). Multivariate proportional modeling determined patients who found it ""very easy"" (5/5) to arrange telemedicine visits had greater satisfaction (OR = 4.928; 95% CI = 0.94 to 25.84) compared to those who found it ""difficult"" (2/5) (p = 0.059).

Existing bioethical frameworks are often not well suited to address the problems of public health. METHODS: The Nuffield Council on Bioethics set up an expert working party to examine the ethical issues surrounding public health in January 2006. Following evidence gathering and a public consultation exercise, the Council published its conclusions and recommendations in the report ‘Public health: ethical issues’ in November 2007. RESULTS: A spectrum of views exists on the relationship between the state's authority and the individual. The Council set out a proposal to capture the best of the libertarian and paternalistic approaches, in what it calls the ‘stewardship model’. This model suggests guiding principles for making decisions about public health policies, and highlights some key principles including Mill's harm principle, caring for the vulnerable, autonomy and consent. An ‘intervention ladder’ is also proposed, which provides a way of thinking about the acceptability of different public health measures. The report then applies these principles to a number of case studies: infectious diseases, obesity, alcohol and tobacco, and fluoridation of water supplies. CONCLUSIONS: The idea of a ‘nanny state’ is often rejected, but the state has a duty to look after the health of everyone, and sometimes that means guiding or restricting people's choices. On the other hand, the state must consider a number of principles when designing public health programmes, and justification is required if any of these principles are to be infringed.",2009-01-09,"Calman, K.",Public Health,,,,document_parses/pdf_json/4712d8fed772e1f91fd429f63020724371ed3aa9.json,document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7118790.xml.json,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0033350608003168; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19135693/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.puhe.2008.10.025; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0033350608003168,23901907.0

OBJECTIVE To compare the efficacy of indirect immunofluorescence technique (IIF) with the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to identify respiratory viruses in children hospitalized for ARI. METHODS 47 nasopharyngeal aspirates of children ≤ 2 years with ARI were included. IFI included respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), adenovirus, influenza A and B and parainfluenza. PCR also included the detection of metapneumovirus, enterovirus/rhinovirus, bocavirus and coronavirus. Sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive value (VPP/NPV) and kappa correlation for RSV were estimated by IIF compared to PCR. RESULTS The IIF detected only RSV (29; 61.7%). PCR detected several viruses, including RSV in 26 cases (55.3%), followed by bocavirus (29.8%), rhinovirus/enterovirus (21.3%), adenovirus (14.9%) and parainfluenza (4,3%) among others, with 35.5% of coinfection.

Such news could be misleading, counterproductive, unethical, unprofessional, and sometimes, constitute a log in the wheel of global efforts toward flattening the virus spread curve. Therefore, aside the COVID-19 pandemic, dealing with fake news and myths about the virus constitute an infodemic issue which must be tackled to ensure that only valid information is consumed by the public. Following the research approach, this chapter aims at a predictive analytics of COVID-19 infodemic tweets that generates a classification rule and validates genuine information from verified accredited health institutions/sources. On deployment of classifier Vote ensembles formed by base classifiers SMO, Voted Perceptron, Liblinear, Reptree, and Decision Stump on dataset of tokenized 81,456 Bag of Words which encapsulate 2964 COVID-19 tweet instances and 3169 extracted numeric vector attributes, experimental result shows a novel 99.93% prediction accuracy on 10-fold cross validation while the information gain of each 3169 extracted attributes is ranked to ascertain the most significant COVID-19 tweet-words for the detection system. Other performance metrics including ROC area and Relief-F validates the reliability of the model and returns SMO as the most efficient base classifier. The thrust of the model centered more on the trustworthiness of COVID-19 tweet source than the truthfulness of the tweet which underscores the prominence of verified health institutions as well as it contributes to discourse on inhibition and impact of fake news especially on societal pandemics.

rp8uo7pe,,PMC; WHO,The impact of Covid-19 on behavioural attitudes in Malta: A year into the pandemic,10.1093/eurpub/ckab165.028,PMC8574239,,no-cc,"BACKGROUND: The Covid-19 pandemic has affected everyone's life as the viral spread dominated the globe, and a number of restrictive measures were instituted. Behavioural attitudes are expected to have been impacted by such measures including the lockdowns. The aim was to explore any behavioural changes since the onset of the pandemic among the adult population of Malta. METHODS: An observational study was conducted through the dissemination of an anonymous survey by using Google Forms on social media (between 1st to 26th of February), targeting the adult residents of Malta. The survey's questions assessed for the increase in smoking and alcohol habits, decrease in physical activity and changes in body weight since the onset of the pandemic. Qualitative and quantitative analyses were performed. RESULTS: The majority of the participants (n = 1034) did not recall an increase in their smoking (91.30% CI95%: 89.41-92.87) and alcohol (88.68% CI95%:86.60-90.48) habits since the onset of Covid-19. However, 49.32% (CI 95%: 46.21-52.37) reported a decrease in physical activity with a common consensus of: “I used to go to the gym more frequently. But now I go less frequently to avoid people” and “More online meetings at home so my physical activity has decreased”. Indeed, 43.23% (CI 95%: 40.24 - 46.27) recalled an increase in their body weight as: “My food intake increased drastically” and “My eating habits have deteriorated as I now tend to turn to comfort eating”. CONCLUSIONS: The pandemic appears to have had negative effects on risk-associated behaviours. There is an enhanced risk for the development of obesity, a disease that is already highly prevalent within Malta. It is recommended that public health advice and promotion for healthy eating and physical activity, even if under lockdown, is strengthened to prevent the development of prospective health diseases and complications. KEY MESSAGES: There is a high risk of an enhanced obesity epidemic with increased sedentary lifestyle since the onset of Covid-19. Action strategies to encourage healthy eating and physical activity are recommended.",2021-10-20,"Cuschieri, S",Eur J Public Health,,,,,,https://doi.org/10.1093/eurpub/ckab165.028,243860130.0

This study investigated podiatrist's perceptions and satisfaction surrounding mandatory CPD requirements following the implementation of a new 2-year CPD programme. METHODS A cross-sectional study of NZ registered podiatrists was conducted between October 9th and December 9th, 2020. Data was collected using a web-based survey. The 39-item survey included questions to elicit participant characteristics, perceptions of CPD, difficulties undertaking CPD, and satisfaction with the new CPD programme. The survey findings were reported using descriptive statistics and conventional content analysis. RESULTS One hundred and thirty-four podiatrists completed the survey. Most respondents worked in private practice (n = 107, 80 %), were in full-time employment (n = 83, 62 %), and had greater than 16 years of work experience (n = 73, 54 %). Respondents agreed it was important to engage in CPD (n = 126, 94 %) and reported that knowledge gained from CPD contributed to their daily work (n = 78, 58 %). 44 % (n = 58) reported difficulties keeping up to date with CPD. The main barriers to CPD participation reported were workload (n = 90, 67 %) and lack of time (n = 84, 63 %). Three categories (understanding the CPD programme; access to CPD; and time to complete CPD) were identified from the qualitative analysis to describe why it was difficult to meet CPD requirements. CONCLUSIONS NZ podiatrists value CPD and are satisfied with most aspects of the mandatory CPD programme apart from the hours attributed to compulsory activities. The current approach to cultural safety CPD requires revision, with a move away from a time-based approach to a system that promotes an understanding and relevance to practice. Lack of time, practice workload, financial barriers, geographical location, and employment context were factors that influenced a practitioner's ability to engage in CPD. Facilitation of CPD activities that are flexible to ensure relevance to the practitioner's specific work within their scope of practice, and that can occur in the workplace environment, may address barriers and increase engagement with to CPD activities.",2021-09-08,"Carroll, Matthew; Brenton-Rule, Angela; Jepson, Hannah; Molyneux, Prue",Journal of foot and ankle research,,,,,,https://doi.org/10.1186/s13047-021-00492-6; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34496936/,237436589.0

We discuss the role of hydrodynamic interactions for three different systems: (i) the deformation and orientation of sedimenting semiflexible polymers, (ii) the propulsion and force-rectification with a nano-machine realized by a rotating elastic rod, and (iii) the deformation of a brush made of grafted semiflexible polymers in shear flow. In all these examples deformable polymers are subject to various hydrodynamic flows and hydrodynamic interactions. Perfect stiff nano-cylinders are known to show no orientational effects as they sediment through a viscous fluid, but it is the coupling between elasticity and hydrodynamic torques that leads to an orientation perpendicular to the direction of sedimentation. Likewise, a rotating stiff rod does not lead to a net propulsion in the Stokes limit, but if bending is allowed an effective thrust develops whose strength and direction is independent of the sense of rotation and thus acts as a rectification device. Lastly, surface-anchored polymers are deformed by shear flows, which modifies the effective hydrodynamic boundary condition in a non-linear fashion. All these results are obtained with hydrodynamic Brownian dynamics simulation techniques, as appropriate for dilute systems. Scaling analyses are presented when possible.

Nearly 1.5 billion children - more than half of the world's student population - are being kept away from school due to pandemic response measures. Nationwide school closures are in force in more than 180 countries while in many others there are localized closures which threaten to become countrywide. The disruption and closure of schools around the world will have a negative impact not just on children's right to education but on other human rights including their right to adequate food. More than 350 million schoolchildren in countries with nationwide and localized closures, might not have access to regular school feeding and nutrition services during the pandemic. In countries where schools remain open, families may also be affected by economic slowdown and fluctuating food prices, and it will be more important to ensure that children have access to nutritious school meals and nutrition services. Where school feeding services continue, there are concerns over gaps in water and sanitation infrastructure and the inability to comply with physical distancing and hygiene measures, as required by governments and by the World Health Organization (WHO). In some cases, fear of infection can also keep children away from school and from having access to school feeding. This joint note from the World Food Programme (WFP), the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) and the United Nations' Children Fund (UNICEF) intends to provide government decision makers, school administrators/staff and partners with preliminary guidance on how to support, transform or adapt school feeding (in the short term) to help safeguard schoolchildren's food security and nutrition during the COVID-19 pandemic. Specific recommendations are provided according to the various target groups involved in school feeding. An additional section is focused on the case of homegrown school feeding.

Methods: All patients positively tested for SARS-CoV-2 and managed at GR between Mar 14th 2020 and Feb 15th 2021 (data cut-off) have been included. Patients underlying oncohematological disease and COVID19 characteristics have been collected. Cancer and COVID-19 management and outcomes have been assessed. Primary endpoint was the overall impact of COVID-19 on oncological and hematological treatment strategy assessed at 1, 3, 6 and 12 months. Results: At the time of the analysis, 423 patients (median age: 62 years) were found positive for SARS-CoV-2 and managed at GR with a median follow up of 5.6 months (0-13 months).

During the study period, nasopharyngeal and middle ear fluid specimens for each acute otitis media event were examined for eight (Cohort Study) or ten (Vaccine Trial) common respiratory viruses; adenoviruses, influenza viruses A and B, parainfluenza viruses 1, 2, and 3, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), enteroviruses, parechoviruses, and rhinoviruses. Picornaviruses (rhinoviruses, enteroviruses, and parechoviruses) were determined by reverse transcription PCR while antigen detection was used for the other viruses. A virus was present in either nasopharyngeal or middle ear specimen in 54% of events in the first cohort and in 67% of events in the second. Rhinoviruses formed the most common virus group detected (41–32%), followed by enteroviruses (25%, sought in the second cohort only) and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) (10%). All the other viruses represented jointly 8–10% of the events. In conclusion, using the methods described in this study, a specific virus infection was diagnosed in two thirds of all acute otitis media events in young children.

METHODS: One hundred fifty patients with French-Canadian (FC) ancestry were evaluated for founder mutations, and 114 patients were subsequently assessed by full gene sequencing and multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification for nonfounder mutations. Two hundred thirty-six patients unselected for ancestry were also assessed for mutations by full gene sequencing. RESULTS: The FC founder mutation prevalence among the 150 patients was 5.3% (95% CI, 2.6% to 10.3%), and the nonfounder mutation prevalence across the four genes among the 114 patients tested was 2.6% (95% CI, 0.6% to 7.8%). In the case series unselected for ancestry, 10.0% (95% CI, 2.7% to 26.4%) of patients reporting Ashkenazi Jewish (AJ) ancestry carried an AJ founder mutation, with no nonfounder mutations identified. The mutation prevalence among patients without FC/AJ ancestry was 4.9% (95% CI, 2.6% to 8.8%). Mutations were more frequent in patients diagnosed at ≤ 50 years of age (P = .03) and in patients with either two or more first- or second-degree relatives with pancreas, breast, ovarian or prostate cancer, or one such relative and a second primary of one of these cancer types (P < .001). BRCA1, BRCA2, and PALB2 carriers with late-stage (III or IV) disease had an overall survival advantage (P = .049), particularly if treated with platinum-based chemotherapies (P = .030). CONCLUSION: Considering these results, we recommend reflex founder mutation testing of patients with FC/AJ ancestry and full gene sequencing of patients who are ≤ 50 years or meet the identified family history criteria. Reflex testing of all incident patients for these four genes may become justified as full gene sequencing costs decline.",2018,"Smith, Alyssa L; Wong, Cavin; Cuggia, Adeline; Borgida, Ayelet; Holter, Spring; Hall, Anita; Connor, Ashton A; Bascuñana, Claire; Asselah, Jamil; Bouganim, Nathaniel; Poulin, Véronique; Jolivet, Jacques; Vafiadis, Petro; Le, Philippe; Martel, Guillaume; Lemay, Frédéric; Beaudoin, Annie; Rafatzand, Khashayar; Chaudhury, Prosanto; Barkun, Jeffrey; Metrakos, Peter; Marcus, Victoria; Omeroglu, Atilla; Chong, George; Akbari, Mohammad R; Foulkes, William D; Gallinger, Steven; Zogopoulos, George",JCO Precis Oncol,,#mdl-35135108,,,,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/35135108/; https://doi.org/10.1200/po.17.00098,80007596.0

Monitoring of the viral load will be a valuable method to reduce the optimal number of quarantine days, especially in presymptomatic and symptomatic carriers of their households. The traditional three-generation families living together are seen frequently in East Asia, including in Taiwan. STUDY DESIGN: We report on a family cluster with six individuals infected with coronavirus disease in Taiwan. METHODS: The current public policy in Taiwan is quarantine for at least 14 days, based on the incubation period, or until the patient has tested negative three days in a row using the SARS-CoV-2 reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. Details on the onset date of clinical symptoms, throat swab conversion, and course of disease were collected from medical records retrospectively. RESULTS: In the household of this three-generation Taiwanese family, the infection rate was 60%. The ratio of males to females was 4:2, and the age range was 11-85 years. The prevalence of asymptomatic disease was 33.3% (2/6). The longest throat swab conversion time was 37 days, and the estimated course of disease from symptoms to first conversion of throat swab was 59 days. CONCLUSIONS: Large families, including three-generation families in a single dwelling, should be monitored when the index case is found.

rrqh9b76,,WHO,Diagnostic Accuracy of Ultrasonography to Detect False Layers in a Commercial Laying Flock Infected by an Infectious Bronchitis Virus Delmarva Genotype Causing Cystic Oviducts,,,,unk,"Infection of the oviduct by an infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) in laying hens has been associated with the false layer syndrome. Because the diagnostic procedure for the detection of cystic oviducts by postmortem examinations in IBV-positive replacement pullet flocks could involve the unnecessary sacrifice of numerous healthy pullets without reproductive tract anomalies, the development of a noninvasive and nonlethal diagnostic procedure would be desirable. The first objective of the study was to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of a transcutaneous ultrasonography method to predict the presence of cystic oviducts compared to postmortem examinations in a commercial pullet flock positive for an IBV genotype Delmarva (DMV) variant. The second objective was to evaluate the performance of the same ultrasonography method to later detect false layers in the same flock in sexually mature hens by identifying the presence of an egg in the oviduct due to the presence of atretic oviducts undetectable by ultrasonography and the absence of cystic oviducts at that age. In replacement pullets, the sensitivity (Se) and specificity (Sp) of the ultrasonography (index test) compared to the postmortem examination (reference standard test) were 73% and 91%, respectively. The positive predictive value (PPV) and negative predictive value (NPV) were 67% and 93%. The ultrasonography technique showed a positive likelihood ratio (LR+) of 7.82 and a negative likelihood ratio (LR-) of 0.30. In sexually mature hens, the Se, Sp, PPV, and NPV of the ultrasonography compared to the laying status were 98%. The LR+ was 49.00 and the LR- was 0.02 when compared to the laying status. In conclusion, the ultrasonography could replace postmortem examinations to detect cystic oviducts in commercial flocks of replacement pullets previously infected with an IBV-DMV 1639 variant. Although the test accuracy of ultrasonography was excellent for the hens at production peak to identify laying and nonlaying hens based on the presence of an egg in the reproductive tract, its practicality was limited due to atretic oviducts being not detectable.",2020,"Parent, Eric; Gagnon-Francoeur, Ariane; Lanthier, Benoît; Hébert, Ghislain; Buczinski, Sébastien; Boulianne, Martine",Avian Dis,,#892406,,,,,212831255.0

To investigate that, we first re-analyzed available case-control epigenome-wide association studies based on DNA methylation data, and case-control gene expression studies based on microarray data. From these published studies, we found an association between ME/CFS and 4 potentially hypomethylated probes located in the ACE locus. We also found another disease association with one hypomethylated probe located in the transcription start site of ACE2. The same disease associations were obtained for women but not for men after performing sex-specific analyses. In contrast, a meta-analysis of gene expression levels could not provide evidence for a differentially expression of ACE and ACE2 in affected patients when compared to healthy controls. In line with this negative finding, the analysis of a new data set on the gene expression of ACE and ACE2 in peripheral blood mononuclear cells did not find any differences between a female cohort of 37 patients and 34 age-matched healthy controls.

Objective Our objectives were 1) to compare the URT microbiome between SARS-CoV-2-infected and -uninfected adults, and 2) to examine the association of SARS-CoV-2 viral load with the URT microbiome during COVID-19. Methods We characterized the URT microbiome using 16S ribosomal RNA sequencing in 59 adults (38 with confirmed, symptomatic, mild-to-moderate COVID-19 and 21 asymptomatic, uninfected controls). In those with COVID-19, we measured SARS-CoV-2 viral load using quantitative reverse transcription PCR. We then examined the association of SARS-CoV-2 infection status and its viral load with the ⍺-diversity, β-diversity, and abundance of bacterial taxa of the URT microbiome. Our main models were all adjusted for age and sex. Results The observed species index was significantly higher in SARS-CoV-2-infected than in -uninfected adults (β linear regression coefficient=7.53, 95%CI=0.17-14.89, p=0.045). In differential abundance testing, 9 amplicon sequence variants (ASVs) were significantly different in both of our comparisons, with Peptoniphilus lacrimalis, Campylobacter hominis, Prevotella 9 copri, and an Anaerococcus unclassified ASV being more abundant in those with SARS-CoV-2 infection and in those with high viral load during COVID-19, whereas Corynebacterium unclassified, Staphylococcus haemolyticus, Prevotella disiens, and 2 Corynebacterium_1 unclassified ASVs were more abundant in those without SARS-CoV-2 infection and in those with low viral load during COVID-19.

The majority of children's questions were about the nature of the virus (34%), followed by lifestyle changes (20%). Older children were more likely to ask about school/work and less likely to ask about lifestyle changes than younger children.

Cardiac rehabilitation (CR) is utilized to promote recovery and improve outcomes, but remains underutilized, particularly by older adults. CR provides an opportunity to address the distinctive needs of older adults, with focus on CVD as well as geriatric domains that often dominate management and outcomes. AREAS COVERED Utility of CR for CVD in older adults as well as pertinent geriatric syndromes (e.g., multimorbidity, frailty, polypharmacy, cognitive decline, psychosocial stress, and diminished function) that affect CVD management. EXPERT OPINION Mounting data substantiate the importance of CR as part of recovery for older adults with CVD. The application of CR as a standard therapy is especially important as the combination of CVD and geriatric syndromes catalyzes functional decline and can trigger progressive clinical deterioration and dependency. While benefits of CR for older adults with CVD are already evident, further reengineering of CR is necessary to better address the needs of older candidates who may be frail, especially as remote and hybrid formats of CR are becoming more widespread.",2022-01-29,"Alfaraidhy, Maha A; Regan, Claire; Forman, Daniel E",Expert review of cardiovascular therapy,,,,,,https://doi.org/10.1080/14779072.2022.2035722; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/35098848/,246423361.0

Methods A total of 628 patients were randomly sampled from 3489 subjects who were undergoing active orthodontic treatment of fixed appliances and the medical records were reviewed. Orthodontic emergency (OE) occurrence was analyzed from 617 patients who had explicit return-visit records after the COVID-19 outbreak. Wilcoxon signed-rank tests, Chi-square tests and a binary logistic regression were performed. Results The return-visit of 98.6% patients was delayed significantly with an increase over 8.98 ± 4.76 weeks (P < 0.001). In general, 32.3% patients suffered from various OEs while waiting for their first return-visit and bracket/band debonding was the most frequently reported category. Most of OEs didn’t receive timely treatments due to the lockdown. The incidence was nearly twice higher than that of the normal appointment times. No correlation was found between OE occurrence and different demographic/clinical characteristics of patients. The therapeutic progress of patients, especially those in stage 3, was postponed due to the occurrence of OEs. Conclusions Regardless of the limitations, our study suggested it’s highly possible that the COVID-19 pandemic has delayed appointments of fixed orthodontic patients. Orthodontic emergencies did bother a minority of patients and couldn’t be settled in time during the lockdown, which had a negative impact on the near-term treatment progress and should be prevented.

We aimed to quantify aerosol concentration produced during different dental procedures. Where aerosol was detected, we assessed whether the aerosol size distribution from patient procedures was explained by the non-salivary contaminated instrument source, using phantom head controls. This study obtained ethical approval within the AERATOR grant. Patients were recruited consecutively, and written consent was obtained. Both an optical and an aerodynamic particle sizer were used to measure aerosol, attached to a 3D-printed polylactide funnel 22cm from the patients face. A range of periodontal, oral surgery and orthodontic procedures were captured using time-stamped protocols. High-fidelity phantom head control experiments for each procedure were performed, under the same conditions. Aerosol was measured for each procedure. Where aerosol was detected, phantom head control and patient procedure aerosol size distributions were compared, with the assumption that if the distributions were the same, aerosol detected from the patient could be explained by the instrument source. 41 patients underwent fifteen different dental procedures. For nine procedures, no aerosol was detected. Where aerosol was detected, the percentage of procedure time that aerosol was observed above background ranged from 12.7% for ultrasonic scaling to 42.9% for 3-in-1 air + water syringe. For ultrasonic scaling, 3-in-1 syringe use and surgical drilling, the aerosol size distribution matched the non-salivary contaminated instrument source. High and slow speed drilling produced aerosol from patient procedures which appear to have different size distributions from a phantom head control and so may pose a greater risk of (potentially infected) salivary contamination. Ultrasonic scaling does not appear to generate additional aerosol above that of the instrument itself and therefore does not increase the risk to dental teams, relative to the risk from being in close proximity to the patient.",2021-06-12,"Dudding, T.; Sheikh, S.; Gregson, F.; Haworth, J.; Haworth, S.; Main, B.; Shrimpton, A.; Hamilton, F.; Ireland, T.; Maskell, N.; Reid, J.; Bzdek, B.; Gormley, M.

Here we present a single-step nanocoating process to endow commercial face mask filters with photobiocidal activity, triboelectric filtration capability, and washability. These functions were successfully achieved with a composite nanolayer of silica-alumina (Si-Al) sol–gel, crystal violet (CV) photosensitizer, and hydrophobic electronegative molecules of 1H, 1H, 2H, 2H-perfluorooctyltriethoxysilane (PFOTES). The transparent Si-Al matrix strongly immobilized the photosensitizer molecules while dispersing them spatially, thus suppressing self-quenching. During nanolayer formation, PFOTES was anisotropically rearranged on the Si-Al matrix, promoting moisture resistance and triboelectric charging of the Si-Al/PFOTES-CV (SAPC)-coated filter. The SAPC nanolayer stabilized the photoexcited state of the photosensitizer and promoted redox reaction. Compared to pure-photosensitizer-coated filters, the SAPC filter showed substantially higher photobiocidal efficiency (∼99.99% for bacteria and a virus) and photodurability (∼83% reduction in bactericidal efficiency for the pure-photosensitizer filter but ∼0.34% for the SAPC filter after 72 h of light irradiation). Moreover, after five washes with detergent, the SAPC filter maintained its photobiocidal and filtration performance, proving its reusability potential.

czadlom1,,WHO,Perseverative Cognition and Snack Choice: An Online Pilot Investigation,,,,unk,"Perseverative cognition (PC), consisting of worry and rumination, has been consistently linked to a variety of poorer health outcomes, namely via the worsening of stress-induced health risk behaviours. However, research into PC and unhealthy food choice, a key health behaviour, still remains relatively unexplored. In the current pilot investigation, 284 participants were recruited to take part in an online food choice paradigm before completing the Perseverative Thinking Questionnaire (PTQ) and the Brief State Rumination Inventory (BSRI). As a reduced availability of unhealthy snacks has been shown to improve snack choice, participants were randomly allocated to either an even condition (a 3:3 ratio of &#8804;99 kcal and &#8805;199 kcal snacks) or an uneven condition (a 4:2 ratio in favour of &#8804;99 kcal snacks). It was hypothesized that higher levels of PC may predict greater instances of poorer snack choices across, or even within, this paradigm. Despite an increase availability of lower calorie snacks leading to a healthier snack choice, both state and trait PC measures did not significantly influence snack choice irrespective of this varying availability. Although, marginal trends were found for higher state PC and higher calorie crisp selections. The current pilot therefore adds to the growing literature advocating for the use of behavioural economic tactics to engender healthier food choices, yet further work is needed to unpick the mediating role of PC (and its components) in snack consumption paradigms.",2021,"Eschle, Timothy M; McCarrick, Dane",,,#covidwho-1143458,,,,,232384094.0

We identified four archetypes with subgroups of GPs tending in the direction of these archetypes: a small group of ‘Sceptics’ (n = 12/8%) considering threats of COVID-19 as overrated and measures taken as exaggerated; ‘Hardliners’ (n = 34/24%) considering threats high and supporting strong measures; ‘Balancers’ (n = 77/54%) who also rated the threats high but were more critical about potentially impairing the quality of life of elderly people and children; and ‘Anxious’ GPs (n = 20/14%) tending to report more fear, depressive and anxiety symptoms.

In this study, we examined suicide rates among welfare support workers and compared them to other occupations in Australia. METHODS We used data from the National Coroners Information System to obtain suicide deaths between the years 2001 and 2016. Using the Australian standard population from 2001 and Census data from 2006, 2011 and 2016, we calculated age-standardised suicide rates and rate ratios to compare suicide rates across different occupational groups. RESULTS Overall, the age-standardised suicide rate of welfare support workers was 8.6 per 100 000 people. The gender-stratified results show that male welfare support workers have a high suicide rate (23.8 per 100 000 people) which is similar to male social workers and nurses (25.4 per 100 000). After adjusting for age and year of death, both males (rate ratio 1.48, 95% CI 1.23 to 1.78) and female welfare support workers (rate ratio 1.49, 95% CI 1.20 to 1.86) have higher suicide rate ratios compared with the reference group (excluding occupations from the comparison groups). CONCLUSION The age-standardised suicide rates of male welfare support workers are comparable to occupations which have been identified as high-risk occupations for suicide. Both female and male welfare support workers are at elevated risk of suicide compared with other occupations.

Therefore, estimating the number of confirmed cases is necessary to provide valuable insights into the growth of the outbreak and facilitate policy making process. In this study, we apply ARIMA models as well as LSTM-based recurrent neural network to forecast the daily cumulative confirmed cases. The LSTM architecture generates more precise forecasting by leveraging both short- and long-term temporal dependencies from the pandemic time series data. Due to the stochastic nature in optimization and random initialization of weights in neural network, the LSTM based model produce less reproducible outcome. In this paper, we propose a reproducible-LSTM (r-LSTM) framework that produces a reproducible and robust results leveraging z-score outlier detection method.

The increased use of digital technologies in higher education has lately been accelerated by the COVID-19 pandemic, thus creating a number of challenges related to the implementation of distance e-learning. The duration of the epidemic situation and the limitations related to the organization of in-person education reveal the simulation training as the main opportunity for the implementation of any practical training of the students in the methodological disciplines in their university preparation as future teachers. The aim of the study is to survey the possibilities of developing the modeling competence of students concerning the simulation of practical training in computer-based distance learning. Research methods. Within the framework of the research, which is oriented at establishing the levels of structure defining competencies (the reflective multisensory competency;the creative competency;the symbolic competency of sign and symbol nature) were measured systematically through goal-oriented observation during practice seminars in the disciplines taught to students. Since both disciplines are practically oriented and suggest the instruction of teaching methods, they entail the design of didactic situations in pre-school and of lessons in primary school education, which facilitates the registering of the levels of structure defining competences, including the competence for cognitive modelling, preeminently formed in the conditions of simulative distance education in electronic environment. The subjects participating in the research are 158 Bachelor's students trained in the professional field Education Science. Results. A low level of the skills for the application of cognitive modelling in the activities students conduct in relation to the design of pedagogical situation and lessons as an element in their practical experience and preparation in the realization of such situations in rela school conditions. The pilot study diagnoses a low level of student achievements in over 65% of the subjects as regards the academic disciplines the study concerns in terms of basic modelling skills. By contrast, in the course of the simulative education a growth of 45% has been established in the concluding study. The intersections and correlations between the level of development of the specific competences and the simulative education have also been established. Statistically verifiable differences (p=<0.05) were established between the pilot and the concluding studies in view of the reflective and creative competency. The symbolizing competency, however, requires further efforts. Conclusion. The results draw the attention to the necessity to look for opportunities to guarantee the creation of the models, in the context of simulative education, with three basic emphases: state (value, role and function in the specific context, phase of development of the pedagogical situation and/or lesson), structure (position of the model in relation to the other models/objects and of its own components - the components of the pedagogical situations and lesson projects) and evolution (opportunities for the design of pedagogical situations and/or lessons after reflection based on simulations). © 2021 LLC Ecological Help.

Methods: Retrospective-cohort study of family physician practice from 1997/98 to 2017/18. Administrative health and physician claims data were collected in British Columbia, Manitoba, Ontario and Nova Scotia. The study included all physicians registered with their respective provincial regulatory colleges with a medical specialty of family practice and/or billed the provincial health insurance system for patient care as family physicians. Median polish analysis of patient contacts and physician-level continuity was completed to isolate years-in-practice, period, and cohort effects. Results: Median patient contacts per provider fell over time in the four provinces examined. In all four provinces, median contacts increased with years in practice until mid-to-late-career and declined into end-of-career. We found no relationship between graduation cohort and practice volume or FP-level continuity.

The CF-extended surface facilitates the usage of a small volume electrochemical cell (1 mL) without stirring. This approach allows making a low-cost three-electrode platform. Working electrode modification with layer-by-layer assembly of polyethyleneimine (PEI), poly(sodium 4-styrenesulfonate) (PSS), and mercury nitrate layers eliminates solution toxicity and provides stable stripping voltammetry measurements. The stable, robust, sustainable, and even reusable Ag/AgCl reference electrode consists of adsorbed 32 PEI-KCl/PSS-KCl bilayers on the CF/silver paste separated from the outer solution by a polyvinyl chloride membrane. The polyelectrolyte-based sensor interface prevents adsorption of protein molecules from biological liquids on the CF surface that leads to a sensitivity increase of up to 2.2 μA/M for Zn(2+) detection and provides a low limit of detection of 4.6 × 10(–8) M. The linear range for Zn detection is 1 × 10(–7) to 1 × 10(–5) M. A portable potentiostat connected via wireless to a smartphone with an android-based software is also provided.

A wide range of products designed to impart antibacterial, antimicrobial, and antiviral properties to textile materials is considered. The main factors determining the appropriate decision on the technological and functional choice of the protective composition are presented, including the nature of the fiber-forming polymer, the tasks that the resulting material is designed to solve, and its application options. Compositions providing the required effect of destruction of the pathogenic flora and their application technologies are described. Special attention is paid to antimicrobial agents based on silver nanoparticles. Nanoparticles of this metal have a detrimental effect on antibiotic-resistant strains of bacteria; their effectiveness is higher as compared to a number of well-known antibiotics, for example, penicillin and its analogues. Silver nanoparticles are harmless to the human body. Acting as an inhibitor, they limit the activity of the enzyme responsible for oxygen consumption by single-cell bacteria, viruses, and fungi. In this case, silver ions bind to the outer and inner proteins of the bacterial cell membranes, blocking cellular respiration and reproduction. Various options to apply microencapsulation methods for the implementation of antibacterial finishing are considered, including: phase separation, suspension crosslinking, simple and complex coacervation, spray drying, crystallization from the melt, evaporation of the solvent, co-extrusion, layering, fluidized bed spraying, deposition, emulsion and interphase polymerization, layer-by-layer electrostatic self-assembly etc. All presented technologies are at various development stages—from the laboratory stage to production tests, they all have certain advantages and disadvantages.

We present a case of incidental durotomy leading to anterior neck pseudomeningocele, compressing the carotid body (CB) resulting in syncopal episodes. To our knowledge, this is the first case report implicating syncopal episodes to CB compression via a pseudomeningocele. CASE PRESENTATION: A mid sixty-year-old patient with history of obesity, hypertension, and diabetes presented with gait impairment and hand weakness. Ossification of posterior longitudinal ligament (OPLL) was diagnosed with computed tomography imaging (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Elective surgery was completed with an anterior and posterior approach for decompression and fusion. Hospital course (San Jose, CA, USA) was complicated by respiratory depression and incomplete tetraplegia. On post-operative day (POD) six, CT revealed anterolateral soft tissue neck swelling; subsequent CT and MRI showed fluid collection expansion, with associated syncopal episodes on POD thirty-nine. Despite interventional radiology drainage, the fluid collection and symptoms returned five days later. The patient ultimately underwent durotomy revision and repair with muscle patch. CLINICAL DISCUSSION: This case highlights the challenges in managing anterior cervical dural tears resulting in pseudomeningocele. Risk factors include anterior cervical corpectomy and decompression, as well as an underlying diagnosis of OPLL. Untreated dural tears may develop into pseudomeningoceles which can contribute to life-threatening outcomes.

The lockdown impacted several aspects of life including the economy. Food security became a growing concern for many households. AIM: The aim of the study was to explore the diet diversity of urban households in India during the nationwide COVID-19 lockdown. METHODS: Information regarding socioeconomic status (SES), family size and information regarding availability and access to food were gathered from 450 households. Diet diversity was assessed using a 69-item food frequency questionnaire. Food variety scores (FVS) were computed for individual food groups and overall. RESULTS: The majority of the households (86.4%) belonged to the upper-middle or upper SES. Households did not experience any constraints in accessibility and availability of food except the meat group. Overall, 84% of the households had low FVS for most of the food groups except for sugar and milk and milk products. The household SES score was positively associated with the milk FVS (B = 0.039, p = 0.020) and negatively with the fat FVS (B = -0.062, p < 0.001). The number of adults (B = 6.773, p < 0.001) in the household positively predicted the FVS of cereal, vegetable, fruit, fat and total FVS.

They can be targeted by small molecule inhibitors, peptides and peptidomimetics, which represent an alternative to protein therapeutics that carry many disadvantages. In this chapter, I describe specific protein-protein interactions suggested by a novel model of immune signaling, the Signaling Chain HOmoO Ligomerization (SCHOOL) model, to be critical for cell activation mediated by multichain immune recognition receptors (MIRRs) expressed on different cells of the hematopoietic system. Unraveling a long-standing mystery of MIRR triggering and transmembrane signaling, the SCHOOL model reveals the intrareceptor transmembrane interactions and interreceptor cytoplasmic homointeractions as universal therapeutic targets for a diverse variety of disorders mediated by immune cells. Further, assuming that the general principles underlying MIRR-mediated transmembrane signaling mechanisms are similar, the SCHOOL model can be applied to any particular receptor of the MIRR family. Thus, an important application of the SCHOOL model is that global therapeutic strategies targeting key protein-protein interactions involved in MIRR triggering and transmembrane signal transduction may be used to treat a diverse set of immune-mediated diseases. This assumes that clinical knowledge and therapeutic strategies can be transferred between seemingly disparate disorders, such as T-cell-mediated skin diseases and platelet disorders, or combined to develop novel pharmacological approaches. Intriguingly, the SCHOOL model unravels the molecular mechanisms underlying ability of different human viruses such as human immunodeficiency virus, cytomegalovirus and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus to modulate and/or escape the host immune response. It also demonstrates how the lessons learned from viral pathogenesis can be used practically for rational drug design. Application of this model to platelet collagen receptor signaling has already led to the development of a novel concept of platelet inhibition and the invention of new platelet inhibitors, thus proving the suggested hypothesis and highlighting the importance and broad perspectives of the SCHOOL model in the development of new targeting strategies.",2008,"Sigalov, Alexander B.",Multichain Immune Recognition Receptor Signaling,,,,document_parses/pdf_json/bc0859f34bfb9b1e75220c42362947892dfdb6f7.json,,https://doi.org/10.1007/978-0-387-09789-3_20; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19065798/,25711848.0

After proving the existence and global asymptotic stability of the disease-free and endemic equilibrium points of the model with constant parameters, we consider a family of Cauchy problems, with piecewise constant parameters, and prove the existence of pseudo-oscillations between a neighborhood of the disease-free equilibrium and a neighborhood of the endemic equilibrium, in a biologically feasible region. In the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, this pseudo-periodic solutions are related to the emergence of epidemic waves. Then, to capture the impact of mobility in the dynamics of COVID-19 epidemics, we propose a complex network with six distinct regions based on COVID-19 real data from Portugal. We perform numerical simulations for the complex network model, where the objective is to determine a topology that minimizes the level of active infected individuals and the existence of topologies that are likely to worsen the level of infection.

Whether the lung function characteristics are related to pneumothorax is unclear. METHODS: We retrospectively evaluated 343 patients who received CT-guided pulmonary PCNBs and underwent preoperative pulmonary function testing. Demographical, lesion-related, procedure-related features and histopathological diagnosis, as well as results of pulmonary function test were analyzed as risk factors of pneumothorax RESULTS: Variables associated with higher rate of pneumothorax were location of lesion, presence of emphysema, and dwell time. The proportion of middle lobe, lingular, or lower lobe lesions in pneumothorax group (30/50, 60.0%) is higher than non-pneumothorax group (113/293, 38.6%). The incidence of emphysema in pneumothorax group was significantly higher than that in non-pneumothorax group (34.0% vs. 7.5%). Obstructive pulmonary function abnormalities, not restrictive, mixed ventilation function abnormalities and small airway dysfunction, correlated with pneumothorax. Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed lower location of lesion sampled and presence of emphysema were independent predictors of pneumothorax. Although dwell time, FEV(1)/FVC ratio, FEF(50%), FEF(75%) and FEF(25–75%) were significantly correlated with pneumothorax on univariate analysis, these were not confirmed to be independent predictors.

akto3c9g,,WHO,Sustained responses of neutralizing antibodies against MERS-CoV in recovered patients and their therapeutic applicability,,,,unk,"BACKGROUND: Zoonotic coronaviruses have emerged as a global threat by causing fatal respiratory infections. Given the lack of specific antiviral therapies, application of human convalescent plasma retaining neutralizing activity could be a viable therapeutic option that can bridge this gap. METHODS: We traced antibody responses and memory B cells in peripheral blood collected from 70 recovered MERS-CoV patients for three years after the 2015 outbreak in South Korea. We also used a mouse infection model to examine whether the neutralizing activity of collected sera could provide therapeutic benefit in vivo upon lethal MERS-CoV challenge. RESULTS: Anti-spike-specific IgG responses, including neutralizing activity and antibody-secreting memory B cells, persisted for up to 3 years, especially in MERS patients that suffered from severe pneumonia. Mean antibody titers gradually decreased annually by less than two fold. Levels of antibody responses were significantly correlated with fever duration, viral shedding periods, and maximum viral loads observed during infection periods. In a transgenic mice model challenged with lethal doses of MERS-CoV, a significant reduction in viral loads and enhanced survival was observed when therapeutically treated with human plasma retaining high neutralizing titer (> 1/5,000).

The same""disillusionment""is true in many other domains, in which autonomous Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) could considerably help to overcome societal challenges and be highly beneficial to society and individuals. Taking the automotive domain, i.e. highly automated vehicles (HAV), as an example, this paper sets out to summarize the major challenges that are still to overcome for achieving safe, secure, reliable and trustworthy highly automated resp. autonomous CPS. We constrain ourselves to technical challenges, acknowledging the importance of (legal) regulations, certification, standardization, ethics, and societal acceptance, to name but a few, without delving deeper into them as this is beyond the scope of this paper. Four challenges have been identified as being the main obstacles to realizing HAV: Realization of continuous, post-deployment systems improvement, handling of uncertainties and incomplete information, verification of HAV with machine learning components, and prediction. Each of these challenges is described in detail, including sub-challenges and, where appropriate, possible approaches to overcome them.

The purpose of this research was to assess the risk of COVID-19 epidemic dissemination in Japan by estimating the current state of epidemic dissemination and providing some epidemic prevention and control recommendations. Firstly, the period from 6 January to 31 March 2020 was divided into four stages and the relevant parameters were estimated according to the imported cases in Japan. The basic reproduction number of the current stage is 1.954 (95% confidence interval (CI) 1.851–2.025), which means COVID-19 will spread quickly, and the self-healing rate of Japanese is about 0.495 (95% CI 0.437–0.506), with small variations in the four stages. Secondly, the results were applied to the actual reported cases from 1 to 5 April 2020, verifying the reliability of the estimated data using the accumulated reported cases located within the 95% confidence interval and the relative error of forecast data of five days being less than [Formula: see text]. Thirdly, considering the medical resources in Japan, the times the epidemic beds and ventilators become fully occupied are predicted as 5 and 15 May 2020, respectively. Keeping with the current situation, the final death toll in Japan may reach into the millions.

This study aimed to assess the effects of liver injuries on the clinical outcomes of patients with COVID-19. METHODS: A total of 1520 patients with severe or critical COVID-19 from Huoshenshan Hospital, Wuhan, were enrolled. Chronic liver disease (CLD) was confirmed by consensus diagnostic criteria. Laboratory test results were compared between different groups. scRNA-seq data and bulk gene expression profiles were used to identify cell types associated with liver injury. RESULTS: A total of 10.98% of patients with severe or critical COVID-19 developed liver injury after admission that was associated with significantly higher rates of mortality (21.74%, p < 0.001) and intensive care unit admission (26.71%, p < 0.001). Pre-existing CLDs were not associated with a higher risk. However, fatty liver disease and cirrhosis were associated with higher risks, supported by evidences from single cell and bulk transcriptome analysis that showed more TMPRSS2+ cells in these tissues. By generating a model, we were able to predict the risk and severity of liver injury during hospitalization. CONCLUSION: We demonstrate that liver injury occurring during therapy as well as pre-existing CLDs like fatty liver disease and cirrhosis in patients with COVID-19 is significantly associated with the severity of disease and mortality, but the presence of other CLD is not associated. We provide a risk-score model that can predict whether patients with COVID-19 will develop liver injury or proceed to higher-risk stages during subsequent hospitalizations.",2021,"Shao, Jiaofang; Liang, Yuan; Li, Yan; Ding, Rong; Zhu, Mengyan; You, Wenhua; Wang, Ziyu; Huang, Bin; Wu, Min; Zhang, Tingting; Li, Kening; Wu, Wei; Wu, Lingxiang; Wang, Qianghu; Xia, Xinyi; Wang, Shukui; Lu, Ling",Hepatol Int,,#1064606,,,,,231827447.0

Methods: This is an uncontrolled pre-post mixed methods feasibility study of READ-MH training at seven sites across five LMICs (China, Ethiopia, India, Nepal, and Tunisia). Outcome measures: knowledge based on course content; attitudes to working to address the impact of stigma on service users; and skills in responding constructively to service users’ reports of discrimination. The training draws upon the evidence bases for stigma reduction, health advocacy and medical education and is tailored to sites through situational analyses. Its content, delivery methods and intensity were agreed through a consensus exercise with site research teams. READ-MH will be delivered to health professionals working in mental health care immediately after baseline data collection; outcome measures will be collected post-training and three months post-baseline, followed by qualitative data collection. Fidelity will be rated during delivery of READ-MH, and data on training costs will be collected. Quantitative data will be assessed using generalised linear mixed models. Qualitative data will be evaluated by thematic analysis to identify feedback about the training methods and content, including the implementability of the knowledge and skills learned.

3suoktsl,,WHO,A platform incorporating trimeric antigens into self-assembling nanoparticles reveals SARS-CoV-2-spike nanoparticles to elicit substantially higher neutralizing responses than spike alone,,,,unk,"Antigens displayed on self-assembling nanoparticles can stimulate strong immune responses and have been playing an increasingly prominent role in structure-based vaccines. However, the development of such immunogens is often complicated by inefficiencies in their production. To alleviate this issue, we developed a plug-and-play platform using the spontaneous isopeptide-bond formation of the SpyTag:SpyCatcher system to display trimeric antigens on self-assembling nanoparticles, including the 60-subunit Aquifex aeolicus lumazine synthase (LuS) and the 24-subunit Helicobacter pylori ferritin. LuS and ferritin coupled to SpyTag expressed well in a mammalian expression system when an N-linked glycan was added to the nanoparticle surface. The respiratory syncytial virus fusion (F) glycoprotein trimer-stabilized in the prefusion conformation and fused with SpyCatcher-could be efficiently conjugated to LuS-SpyTag or ferritin-SpyTag, enabling multivalent display of F trimers with prefusion antigenicity. Similarly, F-glycoprotein trimers from human parainfluenza virus-type 3 and spike-glycoprotein trimers from SARS-CoV-2 could be displayed on LuS nanoparticles with decent yield and antigenicity. Notably, murine vaccination with 0.08 µg of SARS-CoV-2 spike-LuS nanoparticle elicited similar neutralizing responses as 2.0 µg of spike, which was ~ 25-fold higher on a weight-per-weight basis. The versatile platform described here thus allows for multivalent plug-and-play presentation on self-assembling nanoparticles of trimeric viral antigens, with SARS-CoV-2 spike-LuS nanoparticles inducing particularly potent neutralizing responses.",2020,"Zhang, Baoshan; Chao, Cara W; Tsybovsky, Yaroslav; Abiona, Olubukola M; Hutchinson, Geoffrey B; Moliva, Juan I; Olia, Adam S; Pegu, Amarendra; Phung, Emily; Stewart-Jones, Guillaume B E; Verardi, Raffaello; Wang, Lingshu; Wang, Shuishu; Werner, Anne; Yang, Eun Sung; Yap, Christina; Zhou, Tongqing; Mascola, John R; Sullivan, Nancy J; Graham, Barney S; Corbett, Kizzmekia S; Kwong, Peter D",Sci Rep,,#887211,,,,,221355804.0

We have developed a novel bioluminescence-based biosensor to probe a key host-virus interaction during viral entry: the binding of SARS-CoV-2 viral spike (S) protein to its receptor, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). Derived from Nanoluciferase binary technology (NanoBiT), the biosensor is composed of Nanoluciferase split into two complementary subunits, Large BiT and Small BiT, fused to the Spike S1 domain of the SARS-CoV-2 S protein and ACE2 ectodomain, respectively. The ACE2-S1 interaction results in reassembly of functional Nanoluciferase, which catalyzes a bioluminescent reaction that can be assayed in a highly sensitive and specific manner. We demonstrate the biosensor's large dynamic range, enhanced thermostability and pH tolerance. In addition, we show the biosensor's versatility towards the high-throughput screening of drugs which disrupt the ACE2-S1 interaction, as well as its ability to act as a surrogate virus neutralization assay.

The results show that the social representation is organized around five potentially central descriptive, anxiety-provoking and globally negative elements. But death and contagion are the only stable and structuring elements. The other elements vary according to the reason attributed to the object of fear. Depending on how individuals attribute the origin of the virus, social representations of it vary not only in terms of their content but also in terms of their structure. These results indicate how important it is to consider the perceptions that individuals share about the human (vs. non-human) and intentional (vs. unintentional) origin of an object of fear in the analysis of their representation of that object.",2021,"Rateau, Patrick Tavani Jean Louis Delouvée Sylvain",,,#ppcovidwho-319851,,,,https://doi.org/10.31234/osf.io/2dawr,240975078.0

STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: Patients with COVID-19 from 19 designated hospitals between January 1 to February 29, 2020 were included, and the main exposure of interest was administration of thymosin &#945;1. The primary outcome was 28-day mortality. Propensity score matching (PSM) was used to account for baseline confounders, cluster analysis and Cox proportional hazard model was used to account for subgroup analysis. RESULTS: A total of 771 patients were included, and 327/771 (42.4%) patients received thymosin &#945;1 therapy. The 28-day mortality in thymosin group was significantly lower than that in control group (41.3% vs. 60.6%, p < 0.001). After PSM 522 patients were included in analysis and the 28-day mortality in thymosin &#945;1 group and control group were 51.0% and 52.9% respectively, with no significant difference.

This feature allows targeted sequencing aided by computational methods for mapping partial reads, rather than complex library preparation protocols. However, existing mapping methods either require a computationally expensive base-calling procedure before using aligners to map partial reads or work well only on small genomes. RESULTS: In this work, we present a new streaming method that can map nanopore raw signals for real-time selective sequencing. Rather than converting read signals to bases, we propose to convert reference genomes to signals and fully operate in the signal space. Our method features a new way to index reference genomes using k-d trees, a novel seed selection strategy and a seed chaining algorithm tailored toward the current signal characteristics. We implemented the method as a tool Sigmap. Then we evaluated it on both simulated and real data and compared it to the state-of-the-art nanopore raw signal mapper Uncalled. Our results show that Sigmap yields comparable performance on mapping yeast simulated raw signals, and better mapping accuracy on mapping yeast real raw signals with a 4.4× speedup. Moreover, our method performed well on mapping raw signals to genomes of size >100 Mbp and correctly mapped 11.49% more real raw signals of green algae, which leads to a significantly higher F(1)-score (0.9354 versus 0.8660).

A central public health challenge is defining test allocation strategies with limited resources. In this paper, we provide a mathematical framework for defining an optimal strategy for allocating viral diagnostic tests. The framework accounts for imperfect test results, selective testing in certain high‐risk patient populations, practical constraints in terms of budget and/or total number of available tests, and the purpose of testing. Our method is not only useful for detecting infections, but can also be used for long‐time surveillance to detect new outbreaks. In our proposed approach, tests can be allocated across population strata defined by symptom severity and other patient characteristics, allowing the test allocation plan to prioritize higher risk patient populations. We illustrate our framework using historical data from the initial wave of the COVID‐19 outbreak in New York City. We extend our proposed method to address the challenge of allocating two different types of diagnostic tests with different costs and accuracy, for example, the RT‐PCR and the rapid antigen test (RAT), under budget constraints. We show how this latter framework can be useful to reopening of college campuses where university administrators are challenged with finite resources for community surveillance. We provide a R Shiny web application allowing users to explore test allocation strategies across a variety of pandemic scenarios.

This case series collected data from two acute hospitals examining the management of patients diagnosed with COVID-19 who subsequently died (n = 36) and compared this with national and local end-of-life audit data for all other deaths. Our results demonstrated a shorter dying phase (38.25 hours vs. 74 hours) and higher rates of syringe driver use (72% vs. 33% in local audits), although with similar average mediation doses. Of note was the significant heterogeneity in the phenotype of deterioration in the dying phase, two distinct patterns emerged, with one group demonstrating severe illness with a short interval between symptom onset and death and another group presenting with a more protracted deterioration. This brief report suggests a spectrum of mode of dying.

The aim is to complement currently dominant Bluetooth Low Energy Received Signal Strength Indicator (BLE RSSI) approaches. These often struggle with the complexity of Radio Frequency (RF) signal attenuation, which is strongly influenced by specific surrounding characteristics. This in turn renders the relationship between signal strength and the distance between transmitter and receiver highly non-deterministic. We analyze spatio-temporal variations in what we call “ambient sound fingerprints”. We leverage the fact that ambient sound received by a mobile device is a superposition of sounds from sources at many different locations in the environment. Such a superposition is determined by the relative position of those sources with respect to the receiver. We present a method for using the above general idea to classify proximity between pairs of users based on Kullback–Leibler distance between sound intensity histograms. The method is based on intensity analysis only, and does not require the collection of any privacy sensitive signals. Further, we show how this information can be fused with BLE RSSI features using adaptive weighted voting. We also take into account that sound is not available in all windows. Our approach is evaluated in elaborate experiments in real-world settings. The results show that both Bluetooth and sound can be used to differentiate users within and out of critical distance (1.5 m) with high accuracies of 77% and 80% respectively. Their fusion, however, improves this to 86%, making evident the merit of augmenting BLE RSSI with sound.

This work investigates the extension of those results to the prediction of relative performance of athletes running on flat, hilly, or very mountainous outdoor courses. Publicly available race results in the Los Angeles area provided a set of 109,000 times, with 2200 runners participating in more than one race, so that their times could be compared under different conditions. I compare with the results of a traditional model in which the only parameters considered are total distance and elevation gain. Both the treadmill-based model and the gain-based model have some shortcomings, leading to the creation of a hybrid model that combines the best features of each. Author summary Running a race on a road allows absolute measures of performance. Trail running, however, has traditionally been thought of as a sport in which the only valid comparison is between different runners competing on the same course on the same day. Even the exact measurement of distance is considered to be unimportant, since courses and conditions vary so much. An extreme example is the relatively new genre of “vertical” races, in which runners race up a mountain. In a typical example, the competitors cover a horizontal distance of 5 km, while climbing about 1000 m. The winner in one such race had a time almost triple that expected for a state-champion high school runner in a 5k road race. Clearly no comparison can be made here without taking into account the amount of climbing. In noncompetitive contexts, many runners venture onto mountain trails, lightly dressed and with little equipment, so that it becomes important to be able to anticipate whether they will have the endurance needed to be able to safely complete a planned route.

amtf9l6x,,WHO,Using Machine Learning Algorithms to Predict People's Intention to Use Mobile Learning Platforms During the COVID-19 Pandemic: Machine Learning Approach,,,,unk,"BACKGROUND: Mobile learning has become an essential instruction platform in many schools, colleges, universities, and various other educational institutions across the globe, as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic crisis. The resulting severe, pandemic-related circumstances have disrupted physical and face-to-face contact teaching practices, thereby requiring many students to actively use mobile technologies for learning. Mobile learning technologies offer viable web-based teaching and learning platforms that are accessible to teachers and learners worldwide. OBJECTIVE: This study investigated the use of mobile learning platforms for instruction purposes in United Arab Emirates higher education institutions. METHODS: An extended technology acceptance model and theory of planned behavior model were proposed to analyze university students' adoption of mobile learning platforms for accessing course materials, searching the web for information related to their disciplines, sharing knowledge, and submitting assignments during the COVID-19 pandemic. We collected a total of 1880 questionnaires from different universities in the United Arab Emirates. Partial least squares-structural equation modeling and machine learning algorithms were used to assess the research model, which was based on the data gathered from a student survey. RESULTS: Based on our results, each hypothesized relationship within the research model was supported by our data analysis results. It should also be noted that the J48 classifier (89.37% accuracy) typically performed better than the other classifiers when it came to the prediction of the dependent variable. CONCLUSIONS: Our study revealed that teaching and learning could considerably benefit from adopting remote learning systems as educational tools during the COVID-19 pandemic. However, the value of such systems could be lessened because of the emotions that students experience, including a fear of poor grades, stress resulting from family circumstances, and sadness resulting from a loss of friends. Accordingly, these issues can only be resolved by evaluating the emotions of students during the pandemic.",2021,"Akour, Iman; Alshurideh, Muhammad; Al Kurdi, Barween; Al Ali, Amel; Salloum, Said",JMIR Med Educ,,#1067561,,,,,231860868.0

In the first stage, the post-acute care system must, to the extent possible, help relieve acute hospitals of non-COVID-19 patients to create as much inpatient capacity as possible over the surge period. In the second stage after the initial surge as subsided, post-acute providers must protect vulnerable populations from COVID-19, prepare treat-in-place protocols for non-COVID-19 admissions, and create and formalize COVID-19 specific settings. In the third stage after a vaccine has been developed or an effective prophylactic option is available, post-acute care providers must assist with distribution and administration of vaccinations and prophylaxis, develop strategies to deliver non-COVID-19 related medical care, and begin to transition to the post-COVID-19 landscape. In the final stage, we must create health advisory bodies to review post-acute sector's response, identify opportunities to improve performance going forward, and develop a pandemic response plan for post-acute care providers.

Accordingly, this study aimed to evaluate the diagnostic performance of the multiplexed BioFire FilmArray Pneumonia Panel plus (BFPP) for the rapid detection of various clinically relevant respiratory pathogens and genetic markers among 50 patients admitted with HAP to an intensive care unit (ICU) in a tertiary care hospital in Egypt. In comparison to standard culture methods, BFPP showed an overall sensitivity and specificity of 100% and 90%, respectively, with the identification of 11 viral targets (22%) among the tested specimens. The BFPP semi-quantitative analysis showed a concordance rate of 47.4% among positive culture specimens. For the examination of the antibiotic resistance genes, BFPP showed a positive percent agreement (PPA), a negative percent agreement (NPA) and an overall percent agreement (OPA), reaching 97%, 95%, and 95%, respectively, with standard antibiotic sensitivity testing. According to the obtained results, BFPP has the potential to enhance the rapid microbiological diagnosis of HAP cases, tailor appropriate antibiotic therapy, apply antimicrobial stewardship programs, and implement effective infection control measures. ABSTRACT: Hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) is a substantial public health issue that is associated with high mortality rates and is complicated by an arsenal of microbial etiologies, expressing multidrug-resistant phenotypes, rendering relatively limited therapeutic options. BioFire FilmArray Pneumonia Panel plus (BFPP) is a simple multiplexed PCR system that integrates sample preparation, nucleic acid extraction, amplification, and analysis of microbial etiology, with a turnaround time of about one hour. In comparison to standard culture methods, BFPP is simpler, easier to perform, and can simultaneously detect the most common pathogens involved in lower respiratory tract infections (34 targets). Accordingly, we evaluated the diagnostic performance of the multiplexed BFPP for the rapid detection of 27 clinically relevant respiratory pathogens and 7 genetic markers among 50 HAP cases admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU), who submitted mini-bronchoalveolar (mBAL) specimens. In comparison to standard culture methods, BFPP showed an overall sensitivity of 100% [95% CI; 90–100] and overall specificity of 90% [95% CI; 87.4–92.5] among all the tested bacterial targets. BFPP identified 11 viral targets (22%) among the tested specimens. The BFPP semi-quantitative analysis showed a concordance rate of 47.4% among positive culture specimens. For the investigation of the antibiotic resistance genes, BFPP showed a positive percent agreement (PPA), a negative percent agreement (NPA), and an overall percent agreement (OPA), reaching 97% [95% CI; 90–100], 95% [95% CI; 91.5–97], and 95% [95% CI; 93–97], respectively, with standard antibiotic sensitivity testing. In conclusion, BFPP has the potential to enhance the rapid microbiological diagnosis of HAP cases, and could aid in tailoring appropriate antibiotic therapies.",2022-02-27,"Kamel, Noha A.; Alshahrani, Mohammad Y.; Aboshanab, Khaled M.; El Borhamy, Mervat I.",Biology (Basel),,,,document_parses/pdf_json/d4f1e37e99a3da7d43b509689749419bcf2d78cd.json,document_parses/pmc_json/PMC8945136.xml.json,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/35336751/; https://doi.org/10.3390/biology11030377,247174418.0

STUDY DESIGN Case series with chart review. SETTING Tertiary academic medical center. SUBJECTS AND METHODS A retrospective review was completed of 281 patients who underwent both HRM and esophagram from March 2012 to June 2014. Inclusion criteria included a specific assessment of the presence or absence of dysmotility on both examinations. RESULTS Eighty-four males and 197 females were included in the study. Average age was 57 years (range, 16-84). Average time between studies was 19 days (range, 0-90). Motility was judged to be normal in 40.2% (113 of 281) of esophagrams and 46.6% (131 of 281) of HRM studies. However, disagreement between the study findings was significant (P = .04). The sensitivity of esophagram for detecting esophageal dysmotility was 0.69, and specificity was 0.50. The positive and negative predictive values of esophagram for dysmotility were 0.61 and 0.58, respectively.

The translocation of apo B100 into the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and its subsequent assembly into lipoprotein particles is of particular interest as the protein is both very large (relative molecular mass 512,000) and insoluble in water. It has been proposed that apo B translocation occurs in discrete stages and is completed post-translationally(1). Several sites of arrest of translocation were reported to be present in apo B15 (the N-terminal 15% of the protein). We have re-examined this question by in vitro translation coupled with translocation into microsomes, and find no evidence for transmembrane segments in truncated apo B proteins. Translocated apo B17 is strongly associated with the membrane-of the ER, being only partially releasable with alkaline carbonate, and remaining bound to the microsomes following disruption with saponin. The efficient binding of short segments of apo B, despite the absence of transmembrane domains, suggests that apo B is cotranslationally inserted into the inner leaflet of the ER. This will obviate problems caused by the size and insolubility of apo B100, because the growing hydrophobic protein chains will never exist in a lipid-free form during translocation. From the inner leaflet, apo B in association with membrane-derived lipid can bud into the lumen of the ER to form nascent lipoprotein particles.",1991,"Pease, Richard J.; Harrison, Georgina B.; Scott, James",Nature,,,,document_parses/pdf_json/6cf35329edb8d663a047ca4af4ffa28d84b351ee.json,,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1896087/,4358423.0

In the modern era, COVID-19 is the biggest problem facing doctors and scientists around the world. SARSCоV-2 is a multisystem infection that is not limited to lung damage and has the immuno-mediated effect of negative effects on organs and systems, including the kidneys. To date, there is no precise understanding of the pathogenesis of nephrological disorders in patients with COVID-19. Patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) are a group of particularly high risk of COVID-19 infection and high mortality in the development of the disease. THE AIM: to evaluate the features of the course of a new coronavirus infection (COVID 19) in patients with acute kidney injury and terminal renal insufficiency. PATIENTS AND METHODS. The study of clinical, laboratory and instrumental parameters was carried out in 119 patients (67 men and 52 women) diagnosed with COVID-19. The average age of the patients was 63.1±1.7 years. All patients were divided into two groups: group 1 – patients with CKD and HD, group 2 – patients with newly diagnosed kidney damage against the background of coronavirus infection (COVID-19). Statistical data analysis was carried out using the software package ""IBM SPSS Statistics 21.0"" (USA) (Russified version). RESULTS. As a result of the study, it was found that in the clinical picture of COVID-19 patients suffering from CKD and undergoing hemodialysis, such a symptom as myalgia was noted 2 times more often, the percentage of saturation of arterial blood hemoglobin with oxygen (SaO2,%) was significantly lower compared to patients with newly diagnosed kidney damage on the background of infection. The duration of the temperature reaction during the disease was 5 times longer than in patients without CKD. Although the incidence of lung damage in patients of both groups was identical, mortality was significantly higher in the group of patients with CKD. CONCLUSION. In the patients examined by us, proteinuria, an increase in the level of nitrogenous metabolites, as well as D-dimers in both groups, are associated with increased mortality. Mortality in patients with CKD and HD was several times higher than in those without pathology of the urinary system. The severity of the patients' condition was primarily due to the symptoms of damage to the respiratory system, but the degree of renal dysfunction is undoubtedly an important prognostic value. Thus, monitoring the state of individual nephron structures in patients with COVID-19 is of great importance, and emergency nephroprotective measures may be crucial in the fight against cytokine storm. © Nephrology (Saint-Petersburg) 2021.",2021,"Agranovich, N.

OBJECTIVE: The obejctive of this experimental study was to evaluate the immunomodulatory effects of two formulations, Tinospora cordifolia (Tc) and Phyllanthus emblica (Pe) with and without coating of Ocimum sanctum (Os). MATERIALS AND METHODS: After obtaining Institutional Animal Ethics Committee approval, present experimental study was conducted to evaluate the immunomodulatory effects of plant drug formulations against infection induced in mice subjected to major surgical stress. Hemisplenectomy was selected to induce major stress and the procedure for hemisplenectomy was standardized. A model of secondary fungal infection after hemisplenectomy was established followed by the treatment of mice with plant drugs and controls. They were subjected to hemisplenectomy or sham operation and 10(5) C. albicans were injected intravenously. The therapy continued for next 14 days. Kidneys were isolated to estimate fungal load. Fungal load of the kidneys was estimated on post-operative Day 15. RESULTS: The test formulations Tc + Pe and Tc + Pe + Os showed significant reduction in the fungal burden of kidneys as compared to hemisplenectomized control group. However, Tc alone exerted better degree of protection as compared to Tc + Pe and Tc + Pe + Os. CONCLUSION: The formulations, Tc + Pe and Tc + Pe + Os that were developed on the basis of theoretical concepts were not found to be superior to Tc. Though the individual ingredients have been shown to possess immunnostimulant activities, in combination, Pe and Os blunted the effects of Tc. The basis for this drug interaction needs further exploration. Thus, the current experimental study validates immunomodulatory role of Tc. However, the addition of Pe with bhavana of Os does not lead to any augmentation of immunomodulatory activity of Tc.

In order to stem the most-dire effects of the climate crisis, there will need to be increased research, development, demonstration, commercialization, deployment, and adoption of clean energy technologies. The innovation process for energy technologies is especially challenging compared with other technological sectors, and can be strengthened through better use of the unique capabilities of the federal government. Recently, the focus of efforts to enhance clean energy innovation has been on what a stimulus bill and/or single piece of legislation can achieve. However, the federal government possesses numerous other means for strengthening the energy innovation process: (1) taking on a greater quantity of risk in the federal government’s RD&D portfolio; (2) extending the federal government’s support for clean energy technologies through its purchasing power; (3) drawing on the full scope of the federal government; and (4) putting energy innovation in the context of societal transformations.

The objective of the study was to identify the frequency of symptoms of generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) in general practitioners and to estimate the association with particular psychosocial and demographic factors. This is a cross-sectional study, where a total of 531 general practitioners completed an online form that contained sociodemographic variables, questions about fear and perceptions concerning medical work during the COVID-19 pandemic, 7-Item Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale (GAD-7), questionnaire on psychosomatic problems and Fear of COVID-19 Scale. The presence of symptoms of GAD was defined by a GAD-7 score of 10 or more points. Voluntary and anonymous participation, acceptance of terms, and informed consent were requested. A p value of <0.05 was considered statistically significant. Symptoms of GAD were identified in 4 out of 10 Colombian general practitioners; the following psychosocial and demographic factors were associated with a greater presence of these symptoms: female gender, social discrimination, anguish, job disappointment, nightmares, stress and other symptoms of fear regarding the pandemic. Conversely, feeling protected by the state or employer, being satisfied with their job as a physician, and trusting government measures and information were associated with a lower presence of symptoms of GAD. These findings highlight the importance of timely psychotherapeutic and psychopharmacological interventions in these individuals.

OBJECTIVE: Describe the COVID-19 pandemic experiences of and effects on individuals participating in the HERO registry. DESIGN: Cross-sectional, self-administered registry enrollment survey conducted from April 10 to July 31, 2020. SETTING: Participants worked in hospitals (74.4%), outpatient clinics (7.4%), and other settings (18.2%) located throughout the nation. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 14,600 healthcare workers. MAIN MEASURES: COVID-19 exposure, viral and antibody testing, diagnosis of COVID-19, job burnout, and physical and emotional distress. KEY RESULTS: Mean age was 42.0 years, 76.4% were female, 78.9% were White, 33.2% were nurses, 18.4% were physicians, and 30.3% worked in settings at high risk for COVID-19 exposure (e.g., ICUs, EDs, COVID-19 units). Overall, 43.7% reported a COVID-19 exposure and 91.3% were exposed at work. Just 3.8% in both high- and low-risk settings experienced COVID-19 illness. In regression analyses controlling for demographics, professional role, and work setting, the risk of COVID-19 illness was higher for Black/African-Americans (aOR 2.32, 99% CI 1.45, 3.70, p < 0.01) and Hispanic/Latinos (aOR 2.19, 99% CI 1.55, 3.08, p < 0.01) compared with Whites. Overall, 41% responded that they were experiencing job burnout. Responding about the day before they completed the survey, 53% of participants reported feeling tired a lot of the day, 51% stress, 41% trouble sleeping, 38% worry, 21% sadness, 19% physical pain, and 15% anger. On average, healthcare workers reported experiencing 2.4 of these 7 distress feelings a lot of the day. CONCLUSIONS: Healthcare workers are at high risk for COVID-19 exposure, but rates of COVID-19 illness were low. The greater risk of COVID-19 infection among race/ethnicity minorities reported in the general population is also seen in healthcare workers.

However, some of these policies prevent people from physical contact. Consequently, many individuals may rely on social media to obtain information concerning COVID-19. Unfortunately, social media use (especially problematic social media use) may give rise to psychological distress. Therefore, this study thus examined potential psychopathology to explain the association between problematic social media use, psychological distress, and insomnia. Methods Utilizing an online survey, a sample of Iranian young adults (n=1078 with 628 males; mean age=26.24 years [SD±7.41]) completed questions and psychometric scales concerning psychological distress, insomnia, problematic social media use, fear of COVID-19, and COVID-19 misunderstanding. Results Problematic social media use was significantly associated with psychological distress both directly and indirectly. The indirect effects were through fear of COVID-19 (unstandardized coefficient [B]=0.177; Bootstrapping SE=0.026) and COVID-19 misunderstanding (B=0.060; Bootstrapping SE=0.014). Problematic social media use was significantly associated with insomnia both directly and indirectly. The indirect effect was through fear of COVID-19 (B=0.062; Bootstrapping SE=0.019) but not COVID-19 misunderstanding (B=0.012; Bootstrapping SE=0.014). Discussion/Conclusion Due to the pressure of the COVID-19 outbreak, individuals are highly likely to develop psychological distress and insomnia.

A negative impact on the mental and physical health of women, their children, partners, or significant others has been associated with this disease. Web-based and Mobile-based psychological interventions can reduce the burden of the disease through prevention of new cases of depression. It is crucial to know the effectiveness of these interventions to implement them around the globe. This systematic review and meta-analysis aims to assess the effectiveness of Web-based and Mobile-based psychological interventions to prevent depression during the perinatal period. METHOD AND ANALYSIS: A systematic review and meta-analysis will adhere to the PRISMA guidelines. Studies will be identified through MEDLINE, PsycINFO, Web of Science, Scopus, CINAHL, CENTRAL, Opengrey, Australian New Zealand Clinical Trial Registry, National Institute for Mental Health Research at the Australian National University, clinicaltrial.gov, beacon.anu.edu.au, and evidencebasedpsychotherapies.org from inception until 31 March 2021. We will also search the reference lists provided in relevant studies and reviews. The selection criteria will be as follows: 1) pregnant women or women who have given birth in the last 12 months and who were non-depressive at baseline; 2) Web-based and Mobile-Based psychological interventions; 3) comparators will be usual care, attention control, waiting list or no intervention; 4) outcomes will be the incidence of new cases of perinatal depression and/or the reduction of depressive symptoms as measured by validated instruments; and 5) the design of the studies will be randomized controlled trials. No restrictions regarding the year or language of publication will be considered. Pooled standardized mean differences and 95% confidence intervals will be calculated. The risk of bias of the studies will be assessed through the Cochrane Collaboration risk of bias 2.0 tool. Heterogeneity and publication bias will be estimated. Sensitivity and sub-group analyses will also be conducted. Random effects meta-regression will be performed. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: As a systematic review, ethical approval is not required.

Although lungs are considered as the primary infected organs by SARS-CoV-2, some of the other organs including the brain have also been found to be affected. Here, we have discussed how SARS-CoV-2 might infect the brain. The infection of the respiratory center in the brainstem could be hypothesized to be responsible for the respiratory failure in many COVID-19 patients. The virus might gain entry through the olfactory bulb and invade various parts of the brain including the brainstem. Alternatively, entry might also occur from peripheral circulation into the central nervous system (CNS) by compromising the blood-brain barrier. Finally, yet another possible entry route could be its dispersal from the lungs into the vagus nerve, via the pulmonary stretch receptors, eventually reaching the brainstem. Therefore, screening neurological symptoms in COVID-19 patients, especially towards the breakdown of the respiratory center in the brainstem might help us better understand this disease.

This capacity is mainly regulated by TNF-α and IFN-γ, and it has been observed that cell-cell contact, mainly mediated by ICAM-1, is important for MSCs to carry out efficient immunoregulation. Therefore, in the present work, we analyzed the effect of TNF-α alone or in combination with IFN-γ on the expression of ICAM-1. Besides, given the importance of cell contact in the immunoregulatory function of MSCs, we analyzed whether these cells release ICAM-1(+) microvesicles (MVs). Our results show for the first time that TNF-α is capable of increasing the early expression of ICAM-1 in human BM-MSCs. Also, we observed that TNF-α and IFN-γ have a synergistic effect on the increase in the expression of ICAM-1. Furthermore, we found that BM-MSCs exposed to an inflammatory environment release MVs enriched in ICAM-1 (MVs-ICAM-1(high)).

The primary aim was to determine what proportion of patients feel they should proceed with their elective hip and knee arthroplasty surgery during the COVID-19 climate. The secondary aim was to investigate what variables affected this decision. METHODS: Patient information from a single surgeon's waiting list in a district general hospital were recorded. A standardised telephone discussion was had with all the patients noting the severity of pain and the potential reasons for not wanting to proceed with surgery. RESULTS: A total of 70.6% (96/136) of patients wished to proceed with surgery; 29.4% (40/136) did not wish to proceed. The decision to proceed with surgery was not correlated with sex, American Society of Anesthesiologists grade or COVID-19 risk. Those who wished to proceed with surgery had a mean age of 68.5 years while those who did not had a mean age of 72.4 years (P = 0.03). Within the matched subgroups, patients under the age of 70 years were more willing to proceed with primary hip arthroplasty surgery (87.9%) compared with primary knee arthroplasty surgery (57.1%; P = 0.007); 75% of the patients who did not wish to proceed with surgery expressed concerns about perioperative COVID-19 infection. CONCLUSION: There is a significant proportion of arthroplasty patients on waiting lists who would be willing to accept the increased risks associated with COVID-19 to undergo surgery on an urgent basis.

In this work, we report the main glycosidic modifications that occur during the maturation of porcine tissues, involving the sialylation process as determined with lectins. Sialic acids were identified at several levels in a broad range of cell types of nervous, respiratory, genitourinary and lymphoid origin. Nevertheless, the most contrasting was the type of glycosidic linkage between 5-N-acetyl-neuraminic acid (Neu5Ac) and galactose (Gal) expressed in central nervous system (CNS). Newborn CNS abundantly expressed Neu5Acα2,3Gal, but weakly or scarcely expressed Neu5Acα2,6Gal/GalNAc. Maturation of CNS induced drastic changes in sialic acid expression. These changes include decrease or complete loss of NeuAcα2,3Gal residues, mainly in olfactory structures and brain cortex, which were replaced by their isomers Neu5Acα2,6Gal/GalNAc. In the brain cortex and cerebellum, the increase of Neu5Acα2,6Gal/GalNAc molecules was paralleled by an increase of 5-N-acetyl-9-O-acetyl-neuraminic acid (Neu5,9Ac2). In addition, terminal Gal and N-acetyl-d-galactosamine (GalNAc) residues also increased their expression in adult CNS tissues, but this was more significant in structures forming the encephalic trunk. Our results show that sialylation of porcine CNS is finely modulated throughout the maturation process.",2000-08-07,"Vallejo, Verónica; Reyes-Leyva, Julio; Hernández, Jesús; Ramírez, Humberto; Delannoy, Philippe; Zenteno, Edgar",Comp Biochem Physiol B Biochem Mol Biol,,,,document_parses/pdf_json/5983dd565bffc17cbec2386b122ef040c1da628b.json,document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7129425.xml.json,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0305049100002133; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0305049100002133; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11007184/,23453298.0

Additionally, perspective-taking activities engage empathy and have been used to reduce racial bias. An activity was introduced at the start of the semester to promote a more scientifically informed view of traits and intelligence, while also encouraging creativity, evidence-based thinking, and teamwork in an introductory biology course that was taught in an online synchronous format due to the COVID pandemic. Student groups worked in breakout rooms to create a slide in a shared file describing a research plan to test for human intelligence from the perspective of an alien life form. Students had the freedom to choose their alien to have whatever abilities and intelligence they wanted. The activity was highly student-centered, with students showing through their work that an understanding of intelligence is closely linked to the methods used to measure it.

Un traitement immunomodulateur pour réguler à la baisse de choc cytokinique peut fournir des informations sur le traitement de COVID-19. L’utilisation combinée d’un agent immunomodulateur avec un agent antiviral peut donner aux médecins plus de temps pour fournir un traitement de soutien aux patients atteints de COVID-19. Dans cette revue de la littérature, les rôles de plusieurs médicaments anti-inflammatoires ont été passés en revue pour explorer leur efficacité dans la lutte contre le SARS-CoV-2. Summary To date, treatment options for severe COVID-19 remain limited and there is currently no effective drug or vaccine for the treatment or prevention of specific SARS-CoV-2 to treat critically ill patients. A new treatment strategy, in addition to antiviral therapy alone, may be required to have a significant impact on clinical outcomes. Immunomodulatory therapy to downregulate cytokine shock may provide information on the treatment of COVID-19.

Indeed, high prevalence rates of depression, sleep disorders, and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) have been reported in Chinese healthcare workers during the epidemic peak. Symptoms of psychological distress are expected to be long-lasting and have a systemic impact on healthcare systems, warranting the need for evidence-based psychological treatments aiming at relieving immediate stress and preventing the onset of psychological disorders in this population. In the current COVID-19 context, internet-based interventions have the potential to circumvent the pitfalls of face-to-face formats and provide the flexibility required to facilitate accessibility to healthcare workers. Online cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) in particular has proved to be effective in treating and preventing a number of stress-related disorders in populations other than healthcare workers. The aim of our randomized controlled trial study protocol is to evaluate the efficacy of the ‘My Health too’ CBT program—a program we have developed for healthcare workers facing the pandemic—on immediate perceived stress and on the emergence of psychiatric disorders at 3- and 6-month follow-up compared to an active control group (i.e., bibliotherapy). METHODS: Powered for superiority testing, this six-site open trial involves the random assignment of 120 healthcare workers with stress levels > 16 on the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS-10) to either the 7-session online CBT program or bibliotherapy. The primary outcome is the decrease of PSS-10 scores at 8 weeks. Secondary outcomes include depression, insomnia, and PTSD symptoms; self-reported resilience and rumination; and credibility and satisfaction. Assessments are scheduled at pretreatment, mid-treatment (at 4 weeks), end of active treatment (at 8 weeks), and at 3-month and 6-month follow-up. DISCUSSION: This is the first study assessing the efficacy and the acceptability of a brief online CBT program specifically developed for healthcare workers. Given the potential short- and long-term consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic on healthcare workers’ mental health, but also on healthcare systems, our findings can significantly impact clinical practice and management of the ongoing, and probably long-lasting, health crisis.
